The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting.

From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.

For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).

There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",2012-01-03 15:28:18

I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed.

I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. 
When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).
I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.
When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.
The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!

A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. 

The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions.

All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.

The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me ""I guess it would be fine"" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the ""couldn't be bothered"" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring ""last nights waiter"" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",2016-05-31 02:14:54

WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of ""tree huggers"" and ""earth children"", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop.

- We were staying a nearby hotel.
- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.
- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.
- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!
- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.
- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.

Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.

- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...

To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",2018-01-10 01:48:58

No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. 

My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.

To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. 

Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people.

Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up. 

But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  

The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. 

The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries

The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). 

Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good

Baklava - VERY GOOD! 

Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!

The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it.

I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ

Pros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, ""pulled"" pork was moist.

Cons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored.",2012-05-28 17:55:04

The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.

No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)

The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.  

When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.

I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.

The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they ""made up for it"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the ""wet meat"" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",2014-11-12 12:41:29

I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  

The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  

Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  

Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.

I'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.",2013-08-03 16:26:48

We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. 

The two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!

Dessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave.

For $10 or $12 you should get fries with your burger, not a large to share for $8.  I had a bison burger. that was the only reason I went there.  Seems we had 1 beer, 1 iced tea, 1 burger, 1 bison burger and split a large fry, for about $37.  Rather ridiculous. And they try to hard to be different or interesting, but ruin a good meal.  The bison burger was tainted with unnecessary slaw and BBQ on it to call it a Carolina bison burger.  Not worth $12 on its own.

The black bean burger was dry. Sweet potato fries were good. 

Today while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. 

This entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. 

No one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled.

Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long.

He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.

My friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said ""look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days."" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.

Allison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.

One of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut.

When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.

Secondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.

I'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba. I notice that some flavors were used by real fruits but others were just powder which I could definitely taste the different. Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. 

But, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try. 

This is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board, card games and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign. 

Maybe I'm just too picky, but I think it could be better.

I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently, this place is an embarrassment to their industry, and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.",2015-10-08 04:32:10

I brought it back to the shop this afternoon to see if there was any way they could try to fix the front basket, which was pretty mangled, and to give the bike a once-over to make sure it was safe to ride. I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days, but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect, but pretty damn close), but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE.  I couldn't believe it. 

I also want to note that everyone in the shop- from the owners, to the sales people on the floor, to the mechanics, to the dog that greets you at the door- is so friendly and welcoming. I am so happy I found them.",2015-12-05 19:57:23

Think Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight. 

Negatives:
- Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small, and over priced selection.
-Their ""Clearance"" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower. 
- Sectionals by themselves average around $1,000 by brands I've never heard of. 
- The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. 
-Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price. 
-5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa!

-They have a few modern pieces.

The cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey.

It took them about an hour and more to have my car ready. Even worse, in the next morning before I was gonna take my family out for a trip, I found my car had no wiper fluid; hence I had no choice but went back and waste another hour waiting them to refill it.

The car was not thorough cleaned (either outside or inside). I rent the car on May 18th, extremely close to my 25th birthday (June 6th), and still, I was still charged for underage fee, which is extremely expensive -- $20 BEFORE TAX PER DAY. There was just no way to waive it. I should have gone for, and I will recommend others in the future to find another rental company such as Hertz, at which you can always find codes to waive this crazy fee.

The last thing is DO NOT buy the fuel option. Although it claims $1.99 per gallon, this is before tax. You will find the price after tax to be very closed to what you can find outside. And, you will NEVER return the car on empty. This is nothing good but a trick for rental companies to steal 3- to 4-gallon sales from you.

I will never get tired of raving about our experience.  We were honored to use the Hollander not only for our room block and wedding night suite, but we also used the Tap Room as our after-party location and we hosted a brunch for our guests on the beautiful patio on Sunday morning after the wedding.  Everything was perfection and if we could do it all over again, we wouldn't change a thing!

The hotel property is absolutely charming.  The décor in the lobby is beautiful, eclectic, and very welcoming.  The Tap Room is a great place for people to gather with intimate booths and large tables for bigger parties.  The Bar has an amazing selection of local and craft beers and the servers and bartenders are all professional and fast! We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too, and they all look wonderful!

The rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were.  The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location.  The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!

The brunch was perfect.  Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast, but the food is delicious and homemade.  The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly, fast, and takes great pride in his work.  He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made!  The service at the new coffee/dessert café was wonderful!  The Patio was a great place to visit with our guests and enjoy the beautiful St. Pete weather. We look forward to many more brunches there in the future!

This time it was El Sabor Poblano on Federal, which could not look less special if it tried.

I liked that there were 3 fish tacos on the menu.  I picked the fried and battered version, though the tortilla chip covered fish could have been awesome. I was instantly impressed when I opened one of my three and found that El Sabor puts an entire filet of fish in each taco! The flakey meat had no fishy taste. These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and, tomato, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.

Another taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3. There was no detectable gristle here, something I have often come across at this little places.

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.  I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.

I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  

The egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.

The pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.

The server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.

They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days, ""it says it right on the sign,"" i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut",2013-07-12 20:44:45

We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. ""It was totally worth it,"" he later told me, ""Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.""

All because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. 

I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert.

So why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.

You can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.

I rarely write reviews, but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. 

We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.

It was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. 

After getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). 

After ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. 

Once our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. 

They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...

In summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. 

I really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.",2017-09-09 00:09:15

Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  

Tahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.

I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one

My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.

I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.

Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  

My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.",2013-08-03 15:34:15

My sister was visiting for the weekend, so I wanted to show her a solid night on the town that lasted till the wee hours of the morning. We started on Frenchmen, but for whatever reason it was dead. 
Deciding to adventure Uptown we proceeded on a respectable bar crawl, including Delachaise, Columns, and St. Joes, however, at 3 AM the usual Uptown culprits start to raise their heads. A summary of the following dialogue:

Friends ""Let's go to FMs"" 
Me: ""No, too much broken glass""
Friends: ""Let's go to Snake and Jake's""
Me: ""Eh....""
Friends: ""Brothers 3?""
Me: ""I'm afraid I'll hit my head on the ceiling""
Friends: ""The Saint!!""
Me: ""I suppose I haven't been there before, I'm curious.""

After entering the Saint the look on my sisters face was priceless, akin to a deer in headlights look. I kept my countenance, and we ordered a round. Things proceeded as expected ... unwanted dance grinding advances, check! uber drunk guy talking your ear off, check! Big Buck Hunter, CHECK!!! Overall I'm glad I moderately traumatized my sister and sated my curiosity in the same night.

On my travels, I tend to stop from time to time to see if I can find specific bourbons that may be out locally. At this time of year, I did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which I look have their annual release later in the year so it's a surprise to find any of them on the shelf. For example, Elmer T Lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that I asked about.

Despite the fact that I walked away without Elmer T, I still had a great time. I enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better I had a great conversation with Max. He is one of the reasons I will return.

I did walk out with a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that I have not seen locally that I need to investigate. As I said I will return and a five star rating from me should say at all.",2015-04-01 15:45:29

Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the ""wrong"" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires.

The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.
 Here is something I am not sure of, I have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said ""This is how we do it here."" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere.

Arrival: I already read plenty of reviews about no signs marking the location therefore, I looked for Starbucks. I parked in a spot in front of the multi business complex. I went inside to find a guard at a desk that said we have been contracted to hand guests their keys and room number and nothing more. He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.

The Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.
There wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that. I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.

I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time.  Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening.  I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined.  He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team.  One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed.  Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.

There is no ambiance or atmosphere here.  The strip mall where it's located is pretty depressing.  Desi Village may be the only active store in it.  And its decor is tired and old.

So yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.

I decided to get the one-meat plate with ""wet"" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,

We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything.

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. 

The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. 

Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. 

Our group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. 

All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. 

We settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch.

The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.

The burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. 

Another unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. 

The only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done.

Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.

Haven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.

Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.

My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.",2012-08-15 19:17:49

They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.

I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. 

After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my ""finished car"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. 

After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said ""I don't know"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got ""I don't know"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get ""serviced"". 

Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part.",2014-05-08 13:41:39

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.

Why do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.

Lets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.

Round out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. 

Wash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.

Though Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.",2013-11-14 01:23:03

All of a sudden, they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, it should have been offered the four previous times I called.

And now for a full review:

I have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.

On my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.

Being out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.

The interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.

Our waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.

For dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.

Complimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). 

Overall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: 

1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.

2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.

When we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.

All in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.",2012-07-16 17:27:36

I'll just say again, walking up towards the hostess as she watches you approach just feels....weird. 

Our server was nice, and we joked with him about the silly flower in a very knock-over-able vase. We got two drinks--julep and one of their other ones with gin, both of which were utterly average to bad. 

The crowd was sort of stuffy. The bread was blah. The food was pretty forgettable. The tenderloin was good because it was a good cut of meat. The Amish chicken was pretty average, with a not so flavorful and slightly MSG-y twang jus. Their signature grits was underwhelming as well.

In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.

Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  

Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said ""I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!""  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  

I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.",2014-05-26 17:53:55

It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.

They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  

For our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  

Dessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.  The brownie was definitely dry and lacking in taste, though I consider myself to be a brownie snob, so maybe I'm being overly picky.",2009-10-13 23:05:04

We got there at 8 and there was no line (by the time we left at around 11 there was a line down the street). The cover band is awesome. There were at least 10 other bachelorette groups there and a few 50th birthday parties too. Their signature cocktails are great but overpriced in my opinion. I would go back though for another bachelorette party or birthday. Probably wouldn't try if it was any regular night out. Gets very crowded.,2016-04-11 17:33:05

I always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very 
good. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.

Seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. 

The service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. 

I can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as ""the best food item"" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. 

I look forward to many more visits with friends at this location. Check Seasons out and enjoy!",2016-01-04 04:42:19

You will not regret working with Jen! I reached out to a few different florist 2 weeks before my wedding. I was frantic my wedding was only 2 weeks away and didn't have a florist, even though it was a small wedding. I got a hold of Jen, who I might say was very responsive.

I got on the phone with Jen and she was so nice and very genuine. We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind, as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote, staying within my budget, noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet, boutonniere, and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.

On the wedding day, Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise, which was not on the quote.

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.
But whats this? 
There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia,"" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.

No.
No, it can't be! 
I need to score - one .. final .. hit..

Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is Cheeze Wiz?
Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.

Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. 

Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.
 
I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.

The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.
Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. 
The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.

I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.

The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia,"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. 

Only good things can come of this, only good things.

P.S.
ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. 
However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.",2010-08-20 19:16:04

We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.
The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...

We dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. 

Our server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. 

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. 

After our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. 

I ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. 

Anyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!",2018-04-15 13:21:32

However... I would NEVER return to this place again, nor would I Ever RECOMMEND it to Anyone. 

APPETIZERS:
I ordered the BBQ Oysters and..wow.. fucking wow...1st of all the oysters not in their shells. Instead they placed in a soup cup filled with  ""BBQ sauce"" that tasted like cheap Ketchup and Chef Boyarde! Disgusting! The oysters themselves were gooey.

The garlic bread was God awful! It tasted like stale frozen garlic bread. To make matters worse, when I received these appetizers, they were cold.. It tasted and looked like they had been microwaved and left out.  

I also ordered the Chicken wings. They were under cooked, cold and the sauce was nasty.  

The other members of our party ordered entrees. They all said, ""This Sucks!""

This would have been fine because a lot of times the ""run down"" places have the best ""authentic food,"" but this was not the case at Dinardo's.  At Dinardo's you do not get what you pay for as the prices are rather high and the food quality is rather low.    Our server hated his life and made snarky, mean comments throughout our time there which, though entertaining, was kind of unwelcome and unpleasant.  My friend had the mussels which were puny and in an unimpressive sauce--unimpressive being the general adjective I would use to describe any given dish my party ordered.  I had a soup which was extremely salty and bland beyond that and the broiled flounder and ""seafood imperial"" dishes were OK at best.

This particular Starbucks is great. The baristas are always friendly and welcoming. The drinks are made correctly and quickly. I usually go with a Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate or Mocha. I also occasionally order the White Mocha. If you can't tell, I enjoy coffee that doesn't taste like coffee! In the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher! Their breakfast pastry items are always delicious. Try the Cranberry-Orange Scone and you will not be disappointed! Their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well.

Awesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  

For our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. 

Shortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.

For our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.

 I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.

Great first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.

I chose the vegetarian plate and a Greek salad. The salad was the absolute best I've ever had. The cheese was absolutely fresh, the vegetables were fresh and chopped just for the salad, and the dressing and seasoning was perfect. The salad was quite large on its own and could easily make a light lunch by itself.

The vegetarian plate came along with their fresh pita-like bread that is baked fresh every morning, seasoned, pan fried vegetables, rice, and a tzatziki-like sauce drizzled on top.

If I could give zero or negative stars I would!
I've never wrote a review before, but I am going out of my way to say that I had the absolute worst dining experience at the Sake House!! 
And esp families, stay clear! 
So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a ""to go"" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say ""we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried."" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! 
Time that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.

I didn't know what to expect when arriving but I was pleasantly surprised with their upscale polish options like Chanel and many others I actually didn't know I needed in my life until I arrived. 
Service was prompt and I especially enjoyed the extended massage. Most importantly the tools she used were brand new/ had been sterilized. I watched her open the fresh package up, that made me feel good about cleanliness and safety.

I picked a gray color for my toes and did OPI Funny Bunny gel on my nails. So far I'm loving both! 
So nice to see a high end nail salon finally making its way to Nashville. I've gone to others in Nashville that seem to be high end, but it just ends up like a VIP club on the Vegas strip with loud music and sparkles just waiting for a Justin Bieber song to come on. 
CURED was not only high end, but it was classic. Like The Hamptons type of classic but with a comfortable low key brunch with girlfriends mimosa type of vibe. I think it would be amazing for a bridal party with so many photo opportunities. I felt comfortable with their prices, competitive to anywhere else I've gone in Nashville worth mentioning. 

I didn't know where to park so I parked on the side in a random parking lot. Looks like there's a lot of up and coming businesses beside them under construction. So I'm assuming once those are complete, parking will be pretty straight forward?

I liked the food, but you always have to have the first visit to see ""how they do things"" and figure out what your preferences will need to be.

I did use their living social deal so I brought my dad in when he came in from out of town to try it out with me. I like the set up, the quaint house is cute (and well, quaint), but I can see how it wouldn't be ideal it if was jam packed. I imagine you could potentially do family style for some of the pub height tabletops. I did call ahead to make sure that I didn't need to print out the coupon and it could be used from my ipod and to make sure they were open, as the website said to just double check.

We started with shrimp spring rolls, probably the best I've had, the ingredients seemed fresher, and crispier. No shredded lettuce here. Simple and loosely wrapped, but you could taste the individual components. The peanut sauce was tasty too, though they don't have sirracha (spelling?) to add to it, just dried pepper flakes. 

We then got the tom yum (gai?) with shrimp. I know it is hot (because of the name, duh), I usually prefer it a little less spicy (I am white), though I still got a good sour flavor (for instance at Thai chili it's too hot for me, I don't taste any sour). I usually get my tom yum without meat or seafood because I feel the meat gets dried out, but the server assured me the shrimp wouldn't be overcooked, and they weren't. I think they are making sure to use fresh ingredients, but I do prefer straw mushrooms (I think they are usually canned) over the button mushrooms they used. Next time I am probably going to try out a veggie version (i love the soup with the cabbage, and broccoli). The owner did tell me they are trying to be authentic and so maybe button mushrooms and less veggies is more authentic?

We then got shrimp pad thai and chicken pad keo mao (drunken noodle) minus the red pepper. Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).

Like Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the 'orange-y' sauce like other pad thai's, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. 

My dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don't live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way? Regardless, they seem to pride themselves on authentic and quality food and service.

I did include pictures. Oh I did try a thai iced tea for the first time too, pretty tasty, reminded me of chai tea. 

I didn't get to see the bill closely, but it was $24 and some change after the living social deal (takes $20 off), I didn't think that was too bad for 2 for lunch (the total cost), with an appetizer and soup and a drink.",2013-06-24 09:58:07

Chickie's and Pete's is a friendly sports bar, particularly for women, and it has lots of seating for Sunday games.

But, I am not impressed by the famous crab fries, which are crinkled, lightly fried, and seasoned with garlic, chili pepper, and salt. Something about the congealed cheese sauce detracts from the entire experience, and I also prefer my fries to be piping hot.

Ever since Target hit the scene I really have to ask, ""Who even goes to Kmart anymore?"" I asked this to myself out loud the other day as I had to get my meds filled due to a sinus infection. No one looked at me odd, as there seemed to be several people talking to themselves. I now go here because of the stolid contractual war between Express Scripts and Walgreens. Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.

This store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's ""Whitewashed.""  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?

One great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.

The extra star is for the pharmacy, as they filled my prescription out efficiently and with the greatest of ease. The hours are little later than Target.  No problems there and credit when credit is due!

My roommate and I were craving sushi and were recommended to come here by Yelp and a friend so we decided to give it a shot. 

First off, they get bonus points for serving FREE edemame as an appetizer. I usually pay $4 to $5 for it at other sushi restaurants. The mango sake drink I have was alright, but not worth the price I paid for it. 

On to the main event...SUSHI! We had the philly roll, tempura roll, tuna roll, and california roll. They were all yummy, but I would have to say I have had better.

The other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy.

My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa.

The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.

My friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.

Unfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as ""heaven in his mouth"", but that it was not. I've had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.

But everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.

I was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.

I'm conflicted, but I don't know that I'll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn't gel- because I can't even take the polish off myself.  So I'm forced to have nails that I am unhappy with, or go to somewhere else and pay to have this taken off, and then pay to have them re done- all before a 6am flight on Wednesday morning, and it's Monday afternoon....",2013-03-18 20:32:27

Sure, the place is not perfect, but there are ultra-expensive restaurants in the FQ that are also not perfect. Look, cheap food, especially food this good, gives ""wiggle"" room for imperfections.

Breakfast served all day is a bonus. Sometimes you just got to have a lox omelet (under $10) late in the day. The restaurant boasts vegetarian and *gasp* vegan dishes, but someone needs to tell them that cheese doesn't fit into either of those categories. That aside, the french fry poboy, and the mac 'n cheese sandwiches are amazing. So is the Saturday Blue Plate of BBQ Chicken legs. 

Every entree is under $10, well except for the Friday Blue Plate, but why quibble? And who can argue with $5 Bloody Mary's, especially ones that are this good?",2008-12-05 04:04:50

With the established Legends Sports Bar directly across the street I thought this place must have something very special to feel they can compete.

They took over the building that was prevriously used by the Ruby River Steakhouse.  The owners apparently opted not to change a thing about the indoor seating.  Gone are all the cowboy boots, up are various team jerseys. It looks like somebody went to Pro Image at the mall to decorate the place.  Nothing appears to be autographed or evoke a sense of authenticity.

Video games are available for the kids, so bring your quarters.  No dart boards, shuffleboard, air hockey or pool tables.  This is pretty much a dine and drink only establishment.

More TV's in the place than I could count (I figure at least 20), all tuned to ESPN or ESPN2.  No clue at this time if they are choosing to use Direct TV, Dish, or Cable One for their service.  However, they already have made one of the biggest mistakes I think most wannabe sports bars make; they broadcast music rather than sound from a live sporting event.  With live sporting events available almost everyday from 12pm - 12am, you would think they would want to try to emphasize that rather than muzak (tuned to a country station; still feels like the Ruby River).

A word of advice here, if you want people to stay and eat and drink, you gotta give them something on which to focus their attention.  The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.

Typically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.  With a designated driver, it may be fun to experiment.

The food is typical sports bar fare; salads, burgers, pasta.  Most items will cost $9 - $11, with entrees running more.  A few twists on their offerings will ensure that I stop in to try something different, but unless the atmosphere improves, I think I will always leave a little disappointed. 

Those staying at the nearby motel may like the proximity, but I think they might find the walk across the street to Legends worth the extra steps.

It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left.

The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though.

Be sure to look on their website for tour times before going and read the FAQ's. 
- First note: There were many people wearing flip flops on our tours vs. the insisted closed toe shoe policy, but that could be because of the next note.
- Second note: There is no production/brewing on Saturdays so the brewery is quiet and empty.

We looked around the main waiting/lobby area and gift shop waiting for our 12p tour to begin.  We had quite a large group, which had to split into two smaller ones. The tour lasted about 40 minutes, starting with a ten minute video of the history of Yuengling and the rise to present day. Next, the guide takes you out to the brewery, and into the kettle room, around through the lab, the bottle line, and the holding tanks. The tour was informative and hands on. Our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process. She did a great job!

Once done, you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and it's drinks galore. The BEST PART? FREE. Tips are encouraged! ;)

Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like ""I don't like food sitting on the table."" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said ""yes!"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant.

The room was clean with a nice couch to lounge on, a refrigerator, a nice fireplace, ample closet and counter space, and a nice bathroom.  The wine and cheese at 5 was a nice touch as well.  Although this place didn't have a lot of extras, it was a pleasant stay, friendly and helpful staff, a good price, perfect location, and suited our needs just fine for a place in Santa Barbara.

I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a ""white blonde"". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and ""medicine"" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away.

I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! 

We first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.

The looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.

What I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. 

The attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.

Five stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.",2015-12-20 21:47:02

When this Wawa store opened for business, gas prices at gas stations all along Concord Pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them. Sure, this Wawa store could've followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents, keeping the bulk of the profit. But no, they'll have none of that. I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!

Secondly, I love the automatic start/stop digital air pump. So far, I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz. It's a snap to use and I get the exact tire pressure every time.

*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again 
The overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small. Service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated.

Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer. My friend Chris W got the filet mignon and butter poached king crab surf and turf. For dessert, I had a slice of salted pecan pie and he had the ice cream sundae. Every dish at Juniper Commons was top-notch. Chef Sbraga does it again!",2015-04-28 19:43:37

Maybe I just caught them on a bad night, but I didn't really enjoy much about my visit. The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I still would have expected better. 

We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK, but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone. 

The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.

Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.

On the upside, they have somewhat convenient parking in the lot behind the restaurant (near the Shawmont School).

First you enter in and select the wine you would like. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about their stock. (And if for some reason at the end you didn't  finish your bottle they will cork it back up for you to take.) Then select your cheese platter. Lots of yummy stinky cheese to select  from and prosciutto. I wish they had more cured meats but it's all yummy anyway. You pay for the wine and cheese there. Which in a large group one or two people can take care of this  part. 

Then going to get a seat can be difficult but just be patient. There's outdoor seating that's very nice and always a live band playing. Inside upstairs is nice as well. Once you're all set with your wine and group it's time to order. Go to the window and play your order.

The salad was lacking for me. I think such a salad would be so much better with a few more Italian-esque ingredients in it, perhaps a little more anitpasto like. I know, it's not advertised as antipasto but c'mon....this salad was boring.  Throw in a couple of olives, some artichoke hearts, some sliced pepperoncinis.

I ordered a small cold brew with vanilla, easy on the ice. I added a hunk of gluten free zucchini bread (the bread butt; the best part!) to my order and paid with a credit card. They have a fancy touchscreen register that lets you add tip to your card purchase. 

I topped off my drink with whole milk -- which in itself was a real treat. It's so rare to see whole milk at the mixing station! 

Before leaving, I asked what else they had in the way of a GF offering, and the young man behind the counter said ""just the zucchini bread."" That's a real bummer; the zucchini bread is great but I'd love to have more than one option.

Home Wine Kitchen's ""No Menu Monday"" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.

As starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and ""love sauce.""  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.

The staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.

By the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?",2011-08-25 01:22:34

The restaurant is very swanky and the prices show this. I do think the food was worth the price although all of my party thought it was very expensive. I ordered the lobster bake which was delicious. It was not fantastic and there wasn't alot of seafood but it was adequate for me. I also ordered a Neopolitan Old Fashion which was made perfectly. 

My friends ordered the fritters, carpaccio, crab cake and fries. Plus 2 shots of tequila, a lemonade and 2 more old fashions. Bill was $170 which is not bad but some of my friends weren't expected it. 

And I must say something about our waiter. Unfortunately, I didn't remember his name but he was fantastic! Very attentive, nice and even bought out a dessert because it was also one of my friend's bday. He was just real cool.

When we asked for our table, both hostesses looking at their paper, then said they'd have to go check and would be back. 5 minutes later, they returned and did not acknowledge us. Meanwhile, another large party arrived without a reservation and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. We then heard one hostess say to the other that she didn't want to seat them soon because the kitchen was backed up and people were waiting 40 minutes for their appetizers. So unprofessional.
We walked up again, after they continued to ignore us, and asked about our table. They weren't apologetic when they told us that the girl we spoke to earlier that day was new and never recorded our reservation. They continued to tell us that it would be at least a 20 minute wait before they could put our table together. We got a smug ""I'm sorry, but she was new"" and they brushed us off.
I really understand that sometimes things just don't go the way they were supposed to and that people make mistakes. However, a little customer service would have gone a long way. Offer us some water, or a seat at the bar or say that you're doing everything you can to get us in as soon as possible. They basically blew us off and blamed it on the new girl.

Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. 

On to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).

Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.

   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.

  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?

In the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well! 

The hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!

On our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.

At checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did!

CITY TOUR: 1 STAR -Not worth the time or money. We never got a confirmation email when booking over the phone. Then during the tour we had to wait and be hassled over payment that was already cleared on our account. Don't do this tour if you get carsick easily. It was full and we had to sit in the back. You can't see anything on the tour through the tinted windows and you only stop at two places that I never would have stopped at on my own. 

The only intriguing part was the Katrina history during the visit the the 9th ward. Do yourself a favor and take the green street cars, save your money and REALLY see things on your own time. We couldn't get pictures of anything and wish we would have done a walking tour instead or tried the red bus tours.

PLANTATION TOUR: 5 STARS! Our driver Stacie gave us a history of the surrounding area and a lot of cool information on our way to the plantation. Laura Creole plantation had an amazing history. Our guide there was Ethan and he did a really good job explaining about the owners journey to this land and how the slaves were treated and also their journey. We felt that it was a balanced historical view of the plantation in general. After that tour we went to the Oak Alley plantation. The grounds alone are worth the trip. The tour guides really focus on the landowners and not so much on the lives of the slaves living there. But you have some time after the tour to visit the  slave quarters on your own. But we wished that there would have been a more balanced explanation of both experiences like at the Laura Plantation.

SWAMP TOUR: 4 STARS and we didn't even see any alligators! This would have been a five-star tour if we would have seen alligators. But our guide Henry was very thorough and explained a lot of great details about the surrounding area. We got to see some boars, raccoons, and birds. It started to rain with thunder and lightning so we did not see any alligators because we had to go back for safety reasons. We did try to see some alligators but they don't come out if it's cold.

By far the worst pizza I've had. Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. 

Their knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.

I normally don't order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi's, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn't gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late. 

I never want dominoes again. It's just a reminder that corporate chains need to fall and get out the way. I rather pay for quality. Not preservatives and poison.

pIyQ9YmxoQ-UrIs-ANTi8Q,7ktyPHE-NGnWxarOqjIQiQ,EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ,4,1,3,0,"Dearest Reader,

Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. 

As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to ""make me something awesome with whiskey in it."" ""What kind of drink do you want?,"" he inquired. ""I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these."" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the ""The Commodore"" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.

When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.

Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. 

All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.

Still dreaming of that burger,

It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  

I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.

My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?

I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.

The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.

After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.",2010-03-13 22:33:10

After my 3 month old car got rear ended TWICE inside of TWO weeks at the end of October, I took my dealership's recommendation and ended up bringing it in to Prestigious for repairs.  I am really glad I chose them.

First off their place is really clean and professional, you feel more like you are in a bank or a business office than a body shop.  I don't mind the typical ""shop"" feel of most of these places, but the experience at Prestigious is a notch above that and I appreciated it.

Next off, they assigned a specific advisor, Juan Mendez to work with me from start to finish through my repair.  He was really knowledgeable and provided detailed information to me about how they were going to diagnose everything and ensure that all of the various components of the damage were fixed correctly.  There was an added challenge in my case because I was hit in nearly the same place by two different drivers:  one submitted a claim through insurance and the other asked to pay outside of insurance.  I explained all of this to Juan and he came up with a forensically defensible way to determine the value of the damage caused by each of the accidents so that the costs could be assessed fairly and accurately.

Juan set up my rental for me and kept me updated regularly throughout the repair process, which in my case took a while due to the insurance company requiring additional evaluations etc. and the Thanksgiving holiday.  Detailed updates, and the fact that these came to me without me having to ask for them, made it a lot less stressful during the time my car was in the shop.  Juan (and I believe all the other staff who hold similar positions over there) also clearly understands all of the procedures, and deviations that can occur from these procedures, that are related to processing insurance claims and he was always able to answer any questions I had.

I got the vehicle back yesterday and the quality of the work is 1st class.  There is no way to tell that anything ever happened to the back of my car...it looks exactly as it did when I purchased it in late July.  I was particularly concerned about paint matching because all of the exterior damage was to the bumper (a plastic part) which had to be matched to the car body panels (metal parts).  Anyone who knows anything about paint and body work knows that it is a challenge to match paints on different substrates, and most body shops, even Prestigious, have disclaimers about this that are plainly visible in their offices.  I told them up front I was really concerned about this, and they said not to worry.  They were right....they did a dead-perfect color match in my case.  I have mild OCD and I notice even the smallest differences and defects in things, and I was 100% satisfied with the paint match, as well as the gap tolerances etc. on my repair.  If a place can meet my standards, it is going to far surpass most people's standards.

It sucked to get hit twice in two weeks, in a brand new car....but I am thrilled that I found this place as part of the deal.  I would take my vehicles here from now on and recommend them to anyone who wants a top quality job with serious attention paid to fit and finish.",2013-12-06 23:51:40

The food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious!

I chose the former:  compared to everywhere - because if you're from out of town that only seemed fair.  The sad news is that for a vibrant southeastern city where we have two professional sports teams, our sports bars kinda suck.

Sam's is honestly one of two great sports bars in the city.  I really like Sam's and I really like the patio in Spring, Summer, and early Autumn.  But, when compared to so many sports bars across the country in other cities of comparable size with their own sports' teams... Sam's is just mediocre.  

The service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive Southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  Some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since I was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  Wow.  That was just really mean.  I'm sorry.

The food is on the better side of bar fare.  But their beer selection could want for some better beers and a wider variety of selection.  The mixed drinks tend to be a bit weak, in my opinion.

But, hey, it's a bar.  It has lots of TVs and they play the game commentary over the speakers throughout the bar.  All and all, if you want to watch sports at a bar, then I would recommend Sam's.",2011-01-09 03:26:00

There is also staff at the door and they do stamp the kids to make sure they don't wander away on their own or with somebody they do not know.

I like that all the games here are just one token. There are also quite a few different types of games available from Arcade style to games of chance. One thing I did notice is that the game area is larger then the play area which means your kiddo's are more likely to want to spend their time here and your likely going to be reaching for your wallet on more then one occasion.

There was a decent amount of food sent to our birthday party table and even with six kids and five adults there was still pizza left over. I did find the birthday area to be a little crowded and we did on more then one instance accidentally back our chairs into people from the neighboring party table.

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. 

Without even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible.

She gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone's favorite part, and the technician's opportunity to shine!).

When I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn't care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! 

Overall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon.

I had the fish and chips.  The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.

My wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.

I've been here twice now for lunch, unfortunately I am always too late for breakfast. Fortunately though, their lunch is delicious! I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! 

Sad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!

The patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum
a homemade red velvet cupcake with a candle, which LOOKED amazing, and she thought was delicious. Another win at Wildflower, would love to come back for breakfast sometime.",2015-09-24 22:16:52

Spasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.

They start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.

I started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce.

A reconverted 1960's era A & W chain fast food stand [I can detect those old bone shards still!], we enjoyed a wonderful meal at a reasonable price.

I had the catfish smothered in poblano sauce and melted cheese.  They told me it was farm catfish but it tasted like the catfish I used to catch out of a lake near my house as a little kid.  Farm fish never tastes this real.

My wife had chile relleno - fresh peppers, not surprising this time of year but definite kudos to the chef.

Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the ""fanciness"" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol). 

My problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.

I should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.

Four stars for the cake. Two stars for the service.",2016-06-11 21:09:53

oyPscvzbdr9Cs2Q4fJlPCw,SNeyQTRtCwow-8eS-RalZQ,5kZtETKu37RuwHATrB4a5g,2,6,3,1,"The gym part of City Fitness is better than most, good equipment, clean, variety, it's a nice gym. I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.

MBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't ""personal"" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.

If you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+/mo program.",2014-01-17 17:38:39

I got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch.

It's a cozy, quaint, and charming property. The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. 
The decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel. 

Free breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. 

Coffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say ""good morning"" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.

I've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...

A few things to note:
Its location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. 

There's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)

Don't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!

Overall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",2016-02-23 21:31:39

You are reviewing the god damn stadium, not that your a Philly fan, and OMG your team won the world series in 08. 

-The food sucks, they do not have enough vendors, So if your enjoying the game, you pretty much have to get up to buy yourself a pretzel or soda. 
-Point out the worst food, the ""Hoagies"" or whatever are Terrible. Aren't they suppose to be like really good (Believe I'm in Philly). The french fries are mad greasy and no crunch or anything. They were soggy, greasy fries!!!! 
- They have cheap small TVs, that are blurry as hell, so there goes the idea of watching the game while your on line waiting for your food. 
- I would love to understand how the game has just started (3rd inning), and I find empty beer containers everywhere.. 

This is not part of my judgement, but for other people to be aware and be careful 
Philly fans are the RUDEST and NASTIEST people. They are very drunk people, they get in your face, they will spill things on you. Even if your a girl, they have no respect. 

This stadium SUCKS, visit it, knock it off your list, see cheap home runs, since the stadium is built for hitters...

I walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if I should make a purchase. The employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings - definitely try some! And you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste, you can't really make a proper judgment because there isn't enough to judge from? Not the case here!

I got the salted caramel banana, the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake.

Thoughts: OMG!! I never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert. But man after this, I wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding (Although I highly doubt that I could make it half as good)! Their desserts are crafted perfect - three/four layers depending on what you get. The bottom layer the the pudding, second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cake(whatever it was - it was AMAZING), third layer, the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping. The creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth. Everything just comes together so nicely! 

The upside pineapple cake was BOMB. the cake wasn't too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to Taste like what it's suppose to. The pineapple flavor isn't overwhelming but just right. My only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too carameliZed with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew.

Definitely go to this place! I was so sad that there was no option to leave them a tip. (They use an iPad to ring you up). The service/help was so great and I would have left a tip but I had no cash. Any ways, highly recommend this place for desserts!!",2016-01-17 06:11:00

The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter.

friends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. 

hubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. 

our server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  

At the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. 

perhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.

For apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.

For ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.

Now let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.

Overall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant.",2018-02-24 19:10:30

Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   

I had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.

My meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.

Then I had pork schnitzel and ""pommes frites"" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it ""Southern"".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.

I finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.

A lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.

The place was fairly empty at 1 on a Friday and we were lead upstairs. Honestly, there's not much going on up there and it was a bit warm, but we decided to stick it out. Everything on the menu looked great and I decided to get the Catfish Acadian, which is catfish topped with crawfish and sauce with a side of vegetables. My dad got the pork chop.

My dish was great! I have no idea what was in the sauce but it was delicious and it was a perfect pairing with the fish. The vegetables were also really good; they were nicely cooked and fresh. My dad wasn't overly blown away by his pork chop, so if you find yourself here you might want to stick to the seafood.

Bria was our waitress and she was wonderful! She was attentive, kept the fresh iced tea coming and she was extremely personable. She was probably the highlight of the visit.

I'm not sure if I would go back. The food was good, but the atmosphere left something to be desired and I feel like I can get good catfish at plenty of places without going out of my way.

Walking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.

We seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece ""jumbo"" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says ""here's your food."" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.
***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.
I decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.
We finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.
I got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.

I got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone ""youguysdoingalright?okaycool."" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.

Anyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!

2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.
1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.",2014-03-15 18:07:44

I, and many others, am incredibly lucky and grateful that these services exist.  Going through all sorts of life challenges can be painful and frightening when you know you're assumed to be a certain way.  Here, there are no assumptions.  They know who they're working with, and they are sensitive without the need to pry for information.  If you're in need of gynecology and you're not a woman, for example, they know exactly how to handle your needs while prioritizing respect for your identity.

My biggest concern is the physical space in which the Mazzoni Center clinic exists.  I feel sort of exposed in the waiting room.  I hope that they someday have the funds to upgrade to a larger, more private space.

If you visit during youth drop-in hours rather than making an appointment, you will probably wait a very long time to see someone.  This is completely understandable, in my opinion.  They'll advise you regarding what time you should show up if you call.

Occasionally, I've noticed lapses in communication; I have been kept waiting in the exam room before with no one around and no idea how much longer I would have to wait.  This is not a common issue, and I find that, overall, I receive more attentive service here than at any other clinic I've visited.

Many options here can be made vegan by holding the cheese. I absolutely adore the marinated tofu burrito. The tofu has a wonderfully chewy texture, and along with the black beans, the meal packs a protein-filled punch that will leave you full well past dinner-time, should you choose to finish it.  The sweet potato and plantain burrito is purportedly dairy-free, and it's another delicious, filling vegan option. The veggie tacos come with a spicier version of the sweet potato, the marinated tofu and some cabbage on doubled corn tortillas. The tacos are not as filling as the burritos, but they're a delicious lighter option. Finally, a fourth option for vegans: the guacamole burrito. They homemade guac is to-die-for delicious. 

I end up at MexiCali about once a week. I've been going since they were just a lunch truck 8 years back. There's often a line at the restaurant, but this place has been around for years and they have a great system to get you your burrito in a very timely manner.",2012-10-08 16:04:22

Our other appetizer was some sort of grilled cheese that was amazing as well. For our entree we had the fishermen stew that was full of flavor and well balanced. Initially I did not think I was going to like it but it was to die for. Every element of the stew had it's own flavor and it was properly cooked. My girlfriend ordered the steak that came with cauliflower puree and a vegetable medley that was delicious as well. This was the first time we had ever ordered our steak to be medium-well and ever since we've been hooked. The steak was so juicy, tender and seasoned so eloquently and the puree was seasoned beautifully as well.

There were some kinks but not anything I would complain about. After all, our group had 8 people so it was understandable. Second time was probably a month later and I noticed they figured out some of the kinks. Their servers are nice and I genuinely felt like they wanted to make my experience great. I know this because every time I made a request the waiter would literally run to get it. I've never seen a server so dedicated, kudos! Honestly most of the stars I'm giving them is because of their genuine service. Added bonus, they were playing Star Trek, hunger games, and iron man. Nice movie selections haha.

The seafood was ok. It's not their fault; it's Tucson so you know you really can't get fresh seafood. That's why I took off a star. They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's ""trifecta"" or boiling crab's, ""the whole shabang"" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.

Lastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common.

Yuengling lager was the first beer I've ever truly enjoyed and remains in my top five favorites of all time. Smooth, sweet, cheap, it's like me in a bottle. I love that the bottlecaps can be rusty, I like that the taste varies per batch, I even like its relatively low alcohol content. 

The tour was pretty great, the British tour woman was funny in a non canned way. She took a shine to my grandpa and was constantly begging him to sell her his hat (signed, sports, I haven't a clue). I was amazed at how close they let you get to the active equipment, I could've spit in the mash and no one would've been the wiser. The whole facility reminded me of St. Pete Catholic High, 50's cinderblock with a residue of toil clinging to the walls. 

The tasting, that's what you came for right? Fantastic. They were out of Lord Chesterfield, but who drinks that? I ""tasted"" the shit out of the lager, probably 6 times. It makes sense, the bar is next to the gift shop and I went a bit insane in there.

Rooms are clean, heating and AC are quiet, beds are very comfortable and they make it feel special.

Special K is awesome. I cannot say enough about how wonderful and helpful he has been over all of our visits. One of the best reasons to visit this hotel. Did I mention the exceptional staff?

Turn-down service is Sucre chocolates on your pillow. Sweets for the sweet dreams.

The bathroom wasn't as slippery this time. 

This was the first time we used the valet service and it worked great. No more than a 10 minute wait for the car. You can text them from your phone and they text back with how long it will take.

They also hosted a Gold Status reception. We made a brief appearance on our way to a Mardi Gras ball.

Our only glitch was a mini-bar charge on our bill. We didn't consume any of their food or drink and they happily removed it from the bill.

I really wanted to like this hotel- it was charming and in a great location, with cute, unique rooms. It was just my style. Unfortunately, some blood-sucking insects ruined that.
Yup- bed bugs. We found them the morning we were leaving, because they normally come out very early in the morning (we were up at 530). Bleck! The management let us stay as long as necessary to take care of the issue (ie throwing away a bunch of our stuff and bagging the rest in ziplocks to be boiled) but it didn't change the fact that it was gross and a huge inconvenience. I threw away about $300 worth of clothing, shoes and luggage and I'm still worried that we brought the creatures back to our house with us.

I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka and my boyfriend ordered the traditional spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce in both dishes was excellent! The portions were a decent size with plenty of leftovers for my lunch the next day.  Finally, the cannoli was the best I have ever had!

In the East Loop, across from the Pageant, might be one of the most underrated salons in the city.  I first went into this place as a walk-in, and keep on going back.  Yes, I'm a guy, and since my hair is pretty coarse, grows weird, and I want a bit of style to it, I go to hair salons.  At V Vegaz I've never been dissatisfied with my cut. 

When you walk in you realize how spacious the place is, with a bit of a slightly modern, slightly baroque interior design.  There's a nice vibe there too amongst the employees, and you can see that the stylists are happy with the work situation.  Of course, happy stylists, to me, mean better haircuts.

I go to Callie, since that first walk-in, and keep on going back.  Yes, she's real friendly, which is a nice touch, but she's also a great stylist.  I'm a bit wishy washy when I look for a cut, usually changing what I want most of the time.  Callie's sensitive to that, and really understands how my hair grows and where it's going to move.   I think the biggest compliment to her is that, as I'm a once a month haircut kinda guy, my brother and sister told me they really my hair a full month after I had it cut with Callie.  So that's really a testament to her skills.

I've not gotten color there, but it is a full service salon, and not just a turn and burn place.  

I highly recommend this place.",2007-12-14 23:37:38

Unfortunately, all the hotels in Santa Barbara are pretty freaking pricey. A lot of the other hotels started at $400+ /night.  This ain't Vegas where you can get something pretty cushy for $250. This seemed like a decent option on the lower end. Our rooms were about $250 a night. A lot of the other hotels in the area were already booked for the weekend or required more than one night to book. 

Pros: 
-decently priced
-clean and cozy rooms
-charming exterior and grounds
-relatively comfortable beds
-bath and body works shampoo, body wash etc
-free water bottles and fruit waiting for you in the room

Cons:
-dated decor 
-toilet issues: The hook inside kept coming undone. I guess we decided not to get maintenance because we temporarily fixed it, but it kept coming undone so it wouldn't really flush. We were checking out that day, so we decided just to deal with it. 
- door was difficult to open without using a certain technique
-no hair dryer, so bring your own
-no complimentary breakfast
-a bit noisy in the morning, but I slept fine. I guess the window in the bathroom was open or something for some ventilation.

Overall, I still don't think I would've chosen to stay anywhere else in Santa Barbara, so BW Pepper Tree Inn was still a good choice based on the location of the bachelorette and price range.",2017-05-26 06:13:56

I've always loved their ""Awake"" Fizz Tea, but I've also broadened my horizons to include Pearl Tea (aka bubble tea). The taro flavor rocked my socks off.

Because I got it warm, it was in a paper cup and I never knew when a pearl was making its way into my mouth. As a result, I spent half my drink wondering ""is there one in my straw?"" It's totally worth the suspense, though.

I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. 

First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott. 

In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. 

I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, ""24.99.""

I respond, ""That's not right.""

He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.

At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.

THAT'S the unscrupulous part.

CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money.",2010-08-20 20:22:30

Larry's Steaks, situated by St. Joe's University, offers the closest thing to the original Dallesandro's cheesesteak I've found.  The meat is sliced and minced into tiny little pieces, maximizing surface area.  Then the cheese is melted throughout so it covers most of the steak and ensures a heavenly consistency and flavor.  The onions and mushrooms are up to snuff as well.  It's greasy enough to slide down your throat but not so much that it's a mess to eat.  I can't attest to the other menu items, but that hardly matters.

Although you probably won't get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail ""The Tryst"" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow.

Because of its size, it's a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn't impressed. It's served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try.",2016-08-25 18:15:54

I had the worst experience when we went today for brunch that I've ever had in a restaurant since I moved to Tucson 7 years ago! First, before even going today, I called to find out what the brunch entailed and when Rosie answered the phone I told her that I had a few questions about brunch, she told me to hold and never came back to the phone. I stayed on hold for 8 minutes at which I called back and spoke to someone else who just seemed like ""Oh Well."" This brunch was organized by one of my friends, so choice in location was not something I had. We did have a reservation, but were pushed outside because apparently they only planned for one 8 person table and the other table got there a few moments before us and got to choose. The problem with this is that there were two people in our group that are allergic to bees, myself being one of them, and bees were flying all around our table, especially our food. At one point I had to get away from my seat and was not able to return to it for 5 minutes because the one been landed on my waffle and was not leaving. 

At this point my friend and I recognized the danger for the two of us and asked to be moved inside to which we were told ""No."" When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told ""Well, what did you want?"" That's when the manager came up, I explained the situation and he was going to put us at one table to which our waitress, gotten by the hostess came up and said to him ""I already to her that they could not move in here."" What employee talks like that to their boss! The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip. I was so appalled myself, that I did not eat because I just did not want to spend my hard earn money at this establishment any longer.

I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), 
a bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: 

The chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. 

The sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. 

The mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. 

The bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. 

The new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.

I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.",2014-05-07 20:24:38

I got ""the veg"" and the spicy fries.  ""The veg"" is a portabella burger, with grilled mozzarella, picked veg, arugula, and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom, then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary, but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio, and for bonus points it's a potato bun.

Wasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries, etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.

Jay Fatimo or something like that, said he was very busy, as were the other service writers, so he handed me his card, and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan, I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that, sent a picture of my vin, and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed, and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later, still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership, etc.

Aww, you gotta get out earrrrrly for *that*"".  We still laugh about it....

Seeing that Muriel's Jackson Square had such an offering, we made rezzies to ensure we veggies got fed - you'll want to do this too - veggie or not!  They were packed & quoting 2 hr waits & this was at 9pm!

Started w/ drinkys at the bar - Sazerac for the Mr & I had the uber-delish Honey Child cocktail: honey-infused vodka & muddled blackberries.  The Mr liked mine so well that he ordered 1 too, to go w/ dinner & just to be nice, I had another as well so he wouldn't have to drink alone

Their veggie appie had eggplant, of which I'm not a fan so we asked the waitress if they could make their Goat Cheese Crepe, veggie & she said sure.  Since the description said it was topped w/ crawfish, we thought, this would be easy..... but unfortunately, the roulade sauce was made seafood stock. ACK!  Wished you had told us this!  The Mr however, said the crepe was nice & plump, the goat cheese was creamy & smooth & he liked it, barring the sauce

Mains consisted of their Veggie Soiree - this was a sampling of little dollops of veggie tastes - some you'll find on their side dish offerings & some not

Divine beets & roasted acorn squash

Polenta topped w/ chickpeas & a basil sauce - flavorful though those beans were crunchy & could have used a bit more time in the cooker.... same w/ the crunchy wild rice

Yams were very flavorful & had lots of ginger - the Mr got to indulge in both our dollops of chard - I tried a bite & it triggered my dislike for cooked greens

Upon walking into the building, to your right you will enter the lobby. The lobby is adorable with eclectic decorations and 1 million places to sit that are very comfortable. They serve wine every day from 5 to 6 PM, it's nice to relax down in the lobby with a glass of wine and friendly staff..

Speaking of the staff, they are amazing. Checking in is fantastic, Jasmine and Kayla are the ones I dealt with and they are both wonderful. The hotel concierge Roshid is a very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, they are very lucky to have him on staff. The housekeepers are great, the rooms are immaculate. What I love most about this hotel are the fantastic bathrooms, I'm not sure about the regular rooms, but if you get a king spa room, the bathrooms are absolutely amazing. You have a freestanding tub, and a large shower and you can jump in between the two should you be so inclined ha ha. The decor is so attractive, incredible wallpaper, beautiful rugs, everything seems brand new and they keep it in perfect condition. This hotel is a must for anyone visiting Philadelphia. They make you feel right at home at the moment you step in the door. The pictures that you can get from inside the rooms are enough to make up your whole trip to Philly LOL. But if you want to get out and explore Philly you're only steps away from the Liberty Bell and a historical museum. Right in Center City or the old downtown area, you'll find lots of historical information about Philadelphia.  Definitely stop in and stay at the Monaco, you won't regret it!",2017-10-24 21:11:13

I ordered a taste of another similar dark beer to see if the problem was endemic but it wasn't. I would have appreciated it more if the bar tender looked into the off flavor when I sent my beer back. This tells me the bar tender doesn't know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. 

Another thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American ""Shaker"" pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.

The shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here).

I had a Monte Cristo sandwich per the waitresses recommendation and I won't lie, it was pretty disappointing.  Take a stack of turkey and a couple thick slices of ham out of their respective industrial packs, microwave them with some swiss cheese on top and serve on limp french toast.  Somebody out there might like it.  I didn't. 

It came with a salad and fries, both of which were good.  The fries were thick steak fries cooked to a perfect golden brown.

I ordered the pork belly gnocchi, and it was good, but not great. I felt it lacked texture. If the pork belly was crispy, it would have sealed the deal. My husband ordered the trout sandwich, unfortunately, he was disappointed that it was basically a 'tuna salad' sandwich. He did not enjoy it.

Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.

Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  
I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. 

The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much?

For sure one of if not the best place to get a sandwich on the beach anywhere between St Pete Beach & Clearwater Beach. All orders cooked to order. Super Size, gourmet servings and great very friendly service from the owner. Artison sandwiches for the price of Subway. Great cook with well seasoned sauces and dips usually. I always go for the daily special. Today was 3 Shrimp taco's for $6.00 The shrimp were cooked perfectly and served on fresh corn tortillas with a Kiwi sauce with some fresh peppers. Just enough spice and fruit with the shrimp. DELICIOUS. I could have had 6 they were so good. Only drawback is this place is walk up with only bench seating outside. Not a problem given the food quality for me personally but some may p[refer to sit at a table. It's on the bench or to go. A great place if you are staying at one of the local hotel to walk to.

The restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. 

Apparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.

I decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.

My friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.

My boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. 

My friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp ""En Cocotte"" with lump crab meat, roasted jalapeño cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.

I have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.

Even with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.

One wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.

All that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.",2013-05-29 14:29:00

Over the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers, instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger.

I've been here a few times, trying the 500 (lettuce, bacon, cheddar, special sauce) delicious, and also making my own combos with their Kobe Beef burger (I think its worth the extra few bucks). I like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions. The brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special.

Their fries are also extremely delicious. As a huge fan of truffle oil, I can never resist getting their truffle oil fries. When they come warm out of the fryer, coated in truffle oil, there is just no better taste known to man.

A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 

This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.

The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with.

The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.

As if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.

When I go, 90% of the time I just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa. The beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better- weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too.

When I do dine, I often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides. Lately, I've grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas, which I find delicious. Service when dining is usually great.

As for the bartenders, it's really hit-or-miss. Joann is probably my favorite- she's friendly, attentive, funny, and I've really gotten to know her, and I'd give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone. There is a bartender named Nikki though, and if she's there, I always get the worst service. She barely checks on me/us to see how we're doing, she seems unfriendly, if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa, she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking (when I was done and trying to leave), and I've had to wait forever to ask her for my check.

Since we were just two, we were quickly seated. We started off with a couple Highland stouts. It was a nice drink and at a reasonable price. Before our entree, we shared a large garden salad. It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette. 

For entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup.

All of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots.

Anything that they don't carry can actually be ordered in for you but I have to say staff here are not always the best at phoning customers to let them know when their titles are in so one should definitely keep their number by the phone to check in with them after a week or so.

The biggest selling point for me here besides the selection has to be the staff at the tills. It can get a little busy here but lines are always dealt with quickly and I appreciate that they don't push as hard as other locations to try and sign you up for a pure card. F.Y.I to anybody considering the pure rewards program the redemption items are not that great. It took me about a year of collecting just to accumulate enough points for a true blood key chain and when I got it it was placed in a bubble mailer and not even in it's original packaging.

Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (""Cookie Jar"" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.

They text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest.

Another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would ""special order"" anything I wanted. I declined.
Apparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it.

Which is somewhat annoying when you are traveling from another part of town. Whatever, we just had to arrange to arrive earlier than we would have liked to hopefully secure a table, which we did. When we arrived it was quiet and only several tables had guests seated. As our dinner progressed it became more crowded until every seat was filled. Nice lively scene except then you can not hear squat! It made dinner conversation difficult. Boo!!!! I think this could be an easy fix for them. 

Meal/Drinks:  The cocktails were creative and tasted wonderful. Our servers suggestions were pretty spot on as we enjoyed most of her suggestions. 

The guacamole was very good with the exception of the fact that my friend has a nut allergy and we asked to have them left off and of coarse they arrived with them on! They really weren't necessary in my opinion either as I don't think they add much to the dish. The reason I wanted to try this restaurant- The Harvest salad! We all split this as well and it was good. The combination of fruit and root vegetables was delish! The figs were so good and the herbed goat cheese mouse was a highlight on this plate!

Two of us ordered the Veracruz Trigger fish and the other ordered the Serrano Scallops and all of it was wonderful. The white sweet mashed potatoes were interesting! I am glad we tried them. The Veracruz sauce was wonderful and full of flavor. It was a lot of food though. Had we known we would have probably skipped one of the first course selections or split an entree. That'a ok though- lunch for today :)

We also tried the Tostones and Stewed Black Beans. Beans were very good, full of flavor! Tostones seemed very dry but maybe that is what they are supposed to be- this is the first time I have had them. BUT, dipped in the Stewed Black Beans they tasted great!

We passed on dessert as they had no gluten free, dairy free options. Delicia offers many options for restricted diets, which we loved. Just no dessert, which is probably better anyway-we were so full!

1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. 

2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, ""I don't know"" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.

3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.

4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a ""quick bite"" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.

I'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.",2008-04-29 20:03:45

I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.

The service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized.

It is a great location, the food is fresh, and they have a great variety of vegan options. But I find it pretty blah otherwise. I've had the crispy ranch and the curry tofu and enjoyed both of them, but I feel like I expect more out of a specialty vegan place. I did really like chick'n in the crispy ranch. The fries are pretty good too. My green lemonade was way too sweet and lemonade-y for me.

He gave me a price quote in about 30sec and gave me an accurate time frame as to when he could get to Squaw. He even called when he was running a few minutes late.

The smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....

The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like ""why are you here. I have better things to do""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just ""Hey man, what can I get ya?""  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, ""We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?"". The manager says ""Sure."" The guy then says, ""Can we get few beers down here""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says ""Sure!"" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks.

What I got was a very professionally looking haircut that works well with my face shape and made my hair a lot healthier and happier.  My expectations were far exceeded - and it definitely surpassed my last 'professional' hair salon experience.  Plus, the shampoo smelled amazing and the girl was really thorough.  I wish I had brought more cash to tip her!!!  The only thing you should keep in mind before going is time.  I had to wait an extra half an hour and it was the longest haircut I've ever had.  I would much rather have the student take the time to make sure it looks good, however, than have someone do a half-ass job.  I think it's important that the school has a series of steps and checklists their students have to go through to ensure they are giving you the best experience possible.

When I check in my rental on 12/21 and returned 01/02/2018 to visit the counter they told me nothing was found. They also told me that for something with a case go missing was very unlikely. Yet they found nothing. Hmmm, I wonder how it can go missing when it was the only place I left it? I filed a lost ticket with them; Reference Number: 4355421, Reported: 12/21/2017.

They may think their employees may be honest but my $300 radar detector is nowhere to be found at their location. So? Yes, one of their employee's stole it. 

I'm a fan of the concept of picking your car. As someone who has been using the same rental place in St. Louis Airport for 8 months and counting. I can tell you they do lousy job at cleaning the cars. I'm always finding plastic bottles underneath the back seats.

I'm also finding a lot un-wiped of front seat and dashboard areas full of sticky substances. The cars are never fully clean as someone who rents from them weekly.

This location does a shitty job of making cars ready for travel. As someone who has access to the execute cars due to the amount of travel I do. They fail to meet some simple travel requirements you expect when you rent. 

Next time you rent look underneath the seats in the passenger areas and you may find plastic bottle under them.

I would love for them to review the cameras and see who cleaned the car so they can fire them on the day I returned the rental! I brought them thousand of dollars and I do expect a refund for the stolen item.",2018-01-10 03:12:43

I was introduced to Jones at the YEE earlier this year. The food was divine. Comfort food to the max. Mac and Cheese that I could've eaten with a ladle, sliders, pigs in a blanket, delicious cocktails. Yum yum gimme some.

We came back with my mother and fell in love again. The calamari is the best calamari I've had in quite some time. Perfectly crisp, not rubbery, full of flavor. Yum.

For dessert? I had the Duncan Hines slice of yellow cake and glass of milk. Genius.

We came back AGAIN a few weeks ago when a friend was visiting from LA. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. The husband had the Halibut. Our friend had the Roast Beef Dinner. Our friend won when it came to food selection. My belly was so warm and happy after one bite of his roast beef. The meat was succulent, juicy, the perfect medium rare. The mashed taters were creamy with a slight hint of garlic. Mmmm.

Coming from TN, I chose to purchase this vehicle from Glanzmann due to its limited availability and attractive price. I communicated with sales on numerous occasions before committing to purchase from Glanzmann nearly 1000 miles from home.

The process was overall quite simple, though I felt we could have gotten alot more done regarding interstate complications prior to completing travel plans to purchase the vehicle. My only actual complaint stems from the vehicle's description. As an out of state buyer, I was at the mercy of the sales team to accurately describe and depict any conditional issues that might be of interest to a prospective buyer. Unfortunately, none of the issues with this vehicle were highlighted, depicted, described, or otherwise demonstrated throughout the entire sales process. I even asked the sales agent to, while on the phone, inspect the vehicle and describe any possible imperfection so that I could have no surprises upon arrival. I spent several hundred dollars in travel expenses to collect this vehicle, only to discover there were a number of aesthetic defects that deserved attention (large dents, cracked paint, cuts in leather). I had limited time and opportunity to react to these conditional flaws and purchased the vehicle - I had already flown from Nashville to Philadelphia! 

This is obviously a small family-owned dealership. I expected a considerably more honest and direct interaction and was disappointed with the outcome. The automobile is a fine machine, but the defects certainly take away from the value. Mr. Jeff Glanzmann, I implore you to make honesty your #1 policy.  I had the opportunity to purchase the same vehicle, with honestly similar defects, from a dealership in Atlanta for the same price. I opted to purchase yours, incurring not-insignificant travel expenses, because of it's immaculate description.",2012-10-08 16:45:58

Our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel. We started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings. The bacon garlic oysters were average, at best. The oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon, which was disappointing. The buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well. For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of sautéed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).

So, overall, we were underwhelmed with the food, making it a solid 3 stars. On a positive note, our server, Alexander, was great...very hospitable and tried his best to make sure we were satisfied.",2017-01-02 04:29:20

Gabby's wasn't open.  I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   

""We can try Burger up,"" I mentioned.  

""Why don't you just call them?"" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  

True.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  

Viper: ""What was her name?  She sounded hot.""
  
Me: ""Paige.""

Viper: ""Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?""

Me: ""Good point.  At least we have that going for us.""

Paige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  

Burger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  

Burger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  

If I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.",2012-01-03 19:26:16

I had biked passed 16th Street Seafood a ton of times, always wondering what was going on inside.  Now I know the answer, and the answer is- not much. At least in terms of decor. There is a gumball machine, 2 empty candy machines, plus a counter to order at and that's pretty much it. Also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood. There were some frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs- but not else. Still, I threw caution to the winds of Tasker Street and put in an order.

I didn't want to go for fried seafood, so the sandwiches and platters were out.

I got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce ($9.50). Mussels are one of those things I like making at home, but it is way too hot for that right now. . My main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells - 9!   It was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy, broth. As the place is to-go only- they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders, nothing was spilled.

Remember when I said I didn't want anything fried, well that's not ever actually true. So I ended up sneaking in 2 fried shrimps. Not bad, but not worth $1.25 each.",2015-08-30 14:52:02

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement.  In the end, I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.

Their specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!

The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.  But if you can score seats here for brunch, then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).

I hated the phony atmosphere of most places and I really dreaded the small talk I would be forced to have with my stylist.

Then, one day a couple of years ago, I wandered into Andre's salon and I never looked back.  
Andre is warm and personable and made me feel at ease immediately.  Right off the bat, we connected on a topic I care about--dogs--and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  Oh, and the cut and color were fantastic!  My highlights last longer than highlights I have received from any other salon.
For the past year or so, Christopher has been styling my hair and I LOVE him to death.  He is incredibly sweet, down-to-earth and talented!  My hair looks amazing for days after he styles it and, try as I might, I can never get it to look as good as he can.
The last time I was at the salon, Christopher, Leah and I had a blast reminiscing about '80s fashion!  I can't remember a time when I enjoyed going to the hair salon (which is probably because I never have!).
Also, back in the spring, I asked Andre if he would be interested in donating a gift for a charity 5K I was helping to organize.  Being the wonderful person he is, Andre didn't hesitate and put together a beautiful basket that was a hit at the race!  Andre has a good heart and that it what I love about going to his salon!

Get there early or if it's a blowout, stroll around the park. There are tons of interesting places to eat & drink (including a rooftop bar). Tickets are still amazingly reasonable even after all the success the Phils have had in recent years particularly when compared to the NY parks.

I used to go more often before the team became so prominent (right after the park opened), and I sat all over the joint. Not really anywhere I wouldn't recommend. The outfied is a great option. 

After starting with a 17 game pack many years ago & then buying season tix a few years back (which my company still has), the staff was great about recommending sections that would avoid direct sunlight , etc. (3rd base field level is awesome).

If you are visiting or considering a trip, don't buy the negative publicity about the Philly fans. The crowds are great. Sure, you have idiots and maniacs like you do at any park and for any professional sporting event, but they are by far the minority and Citizens Bank Park is policed pretty well for nonsense. 

I was once with a group of guys & we stood out in one of the open standing areas between 3rd base & the left field wall the whole night. At one point a very nice officer politely asked us not to curse because there were families around. We we were far from out of control, and we all thought that was pretty cool... so we had fun with some occasional lighthearted banter with the officer for the rest of the night.

All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.

I also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.

For my side, I chose their ""spicy carrots"" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.

Our food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.",2015-03-19 04:54:53

It has a cool hipster vibe, without being annoying :)  The burgers are outstanding, and there are endless options, whether you prefer beef, chicken, seafood, or veggie!  I would recommend the Woodstock - the Jack Daniels Maple Ketchup is out of this world, and Benton's bacon is always delicious.  Upgrade to the truffle fries; they're to die for.  Or, if you're a vegetarian, the troyathalon is a great option.  Filling, with great texture and flavor.  As far as drinks go, 12 South Lemonade.

The customer service is also great.  They've always been attentive, but not ""on top of you"", and they're very knowledgable about their food.  Parking can be a bit difficult at certain times of the day, but it's worth a short walk if necessary.

I would definitely recommend checking it out!",2016-06-12 04:35:25

Every Valentine's Day I try to find some cute, new little BYO for me and my boyfriend to try out and I spend weeks scouring menus and Yelp reviews. 

Every year SOMETHING goes wrong and I get frustrated and pissed off and he always says ""Let's go to Jones"".

This year was no different. We went out last night (2/12/11...the weekend before Valentines Day) to the BYO I picked out and when I made our reservations, no mention was made that they had a special fixed menu that night consisting SOLELY of seafood, which I am allergic to. As I started to get upset at our table, my boyfriend said ""Let's go to Jones"".

We got there, were told there was a little bit of a wait, so we sat at the bar for a drink. About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.

We both got the filet, done rare and the spinach it came with was fantastic. The mac and cheese is also an app we get every time and is one of my favorites. I got the deviled eggs for the first time and holy crap they were amazing. I'm gonna say, possibly the best ones I've ever had (sorry, Dad). 

Everything about this restaurant leans towards comfort and it's always done so well. The atmosphere, the staff, the decor, the food, hell even the temperature. I've never had a bad experience at Jones and I don't think I ever will.

Appearance: The Cake Bake Shop is a beautifully decorated, small white house with a captivating design. The flowers around the sign make it an #instaworthy post for sure, and when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating must be gorgeous.

Inside the Cake Shop will take your breath away, light airy colors and flowers and twinkling lights. This isn't the kind of cake shop you do take-out at, you'll want to sit and enjoy. 

Food: I wanted to try the Raspberry Champagne cake, unfortunately one wouldn't be ready for a little while, so I ordered a slice of the Red Velvet  Cake. The floral icing work was so perfect I didn't want to touch it, but I had to because come on it's cake. What I assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and I never wanted the cake to end. ***I felt one slice was plenty for two people, it's HUGE

I was torn between the Rose Cappuccino and the Lavender Latte. I went with the Lavender Latte, hot, and it was stunning, it was a creamy, smooth, not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering, it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life. 

Price: the coffee is pricy, $6, so not a regular coffee stop for me, but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned, it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was, I think it's so worth it.

Customer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness, care, and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind, they helped me decide what to try, and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet! 

I will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet. This place has my heart and is a hidden gem to anyone who has a sweet tooth!

I usually get the red or green curry, and almost always get it ""native thai hot"". I have tried other things on the menu, but they are not quite as good. So I stick with what tastes good and works for me. 

The lady that owns the place is very kind and always very gracious to my wife and I. She always recognizes us and serves us promptly. She not only owns the place, but she waits all of the tables most of the time(which I think is pretty impressive). 
The place is beside a go-cart track, so that makes it a little quirky, but it's something I have grown accustomed to.

If so, you can briefly tour the lounge area upstairs (red couches, decorative pieces). There's a wrap-around balcony where you can get a great view of Jackson Square. 

If you're curious, learn why Muriel's is haunted and find out the story behind why there's a table that is always set for two located near the stairs. 

There are two main dining rooms, a middle section (indoor patio dining area) that I personally prefer because it is quieter, and a bar area located at the back near the restrooms. I love the indoor patio dining area because it brings a bit of the outdoors in a quiet indoor setting. 

On my first visit, I ordered from the dinner pre-fix menu which is a great deal (appetizer or soup + entrée + dessert = $40). The seafood gumbo soup was hearty and delicious. The dijon mustard encrusted salmon was cooked perfectly. The bread pudding was a great way to end a delicious meal.

I returned to Muriel's for lunch on another NOLA trip and tried the wood grilled pork chop. The pork chop was flavorful, tender, and moist. I was not too crazy about the red beans and rice it was served with as I found it a bit bland. The entrée was served in a bowl but should perhaps be served on a plate since it was difficult to slice the pork chop since it kept sinking into the bed of red beans and rice.

The car had a Sonic price of 16900.  I put 6 thousand down and still owed over 16,000 on the car at 5 % interest for 72 months.  I could have bought a new car for that price.

For the table, we started with 4 of the small plates for $16-- the hummus, the hot potatoes, the olives, and the pickles. The hummus was incredible and a really large portion. The hot potatoes had great flavor but were served in a tiny bowl-- each of us was able to only have one small bite. The olives were served warm and were quite tasty. The pickles were a-okay, but I probably would not reorder these. 

For our mains, my mom and I split the trout, my husband had the roast beef sandwich, and our friend had the burger. The trout, in my opinion, was overly charred and lacked seasoning. Also, it was a whole trout, which, to be fair, is stated on the menu, but I do wish that the server or waitress would have explained a better way to debone the fish or offer to do it for us. We ended up with a weird pile of fish after we butchered it. The highlight of the trout was the potato gnocchi salad served on the side. OMG it was INCREDIBLE. I would order the subpar trout again in order to get this gnocchi side. 

My husband did not like his roast beef sandwich. I think he was expecting more of a French Dip, and this was more of a cold cut sandwich. The tomato on it was mealy, and he found the onion jam to be a bit too sweet. After a few bites, he gave up and focused on his side of kale slaw, which was very tasty. (The manager did take this off the bill).

The friend had rave reviews on his burger and fries so those are a big thumbs up. 

The manager came around to check on our meal, and we gave him his honest feedback. He seemed appreciative and brought out two desserts-- the brown sugar panna cotta and the peanut butter banana whoopie pies-- on the house. These desserts were definitely highlights so I would recommend saving room for the sweets at the end.

Service overall was fine for the first week. Some low points were that my drink (the Outsider) took 45 minutes to get to me and tasted strongly of lemon. Our waitress also took away our apps before they were finished-- this is a huge pet peeve of mine, especially because the olives, pickles, and hummus could have been used to jazz up the flavor of the trout.

They'll steam them up for you right there should you choose, bring them home or relax at one of the few tables within this Lobster Shack or in their newer room to accommodate a larger party.

Among the traditional New England staples such as Ipswich Clams, Maine Lobster, Sea Scallops, Cod, Haddock &/or freshly made Clam Chowder, etc...

Family-owned and -run, there always seem to be the same people (and, sometimes, their kids) behind the counter.
I mainly come for the tamales, tortillas (voted Best of Tucson for a couple of years, and they include one with most combo meals) and flautas. Man, those flautas... They also have what I think is some of the best salsa in the city. Not too spicy, well-balanced, nice color, good consistency... like a fine wine. I'll usually save their salsa cups for use with other Mexican food that I get later.
If you like fake cheese nachos, then this is your place. But do yourself a favor and tell them to hold the onions because, otherwise, you'll find one has exploded in your container and it will take you two days to get the taste out of your mouth.
The best part about this place though is the price: cheap, cheap, cheap! Most of the combos run about $5 and include an entree, rice, beans, one tortilla and a couple of salsa cups. I usually make myself a little bean & rice burro when I'm done with the meal. Good stuff!

Ti1_Kfd5RvRoonRo98BGcg,4EmbGM_rtM0YDNBdnxzAhQ,2oav5QoWgnvTI2gO5xFMjw,4,1,0,0,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco on a recent visit to Philadelphia and I was impressed with almost everything. Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. 

The Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. 

The only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. 

The Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!

Overall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It's a new hotel, so I'm sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains.",2013-01-28 18:42:40

I walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.

The service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.

My most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.

Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink.
Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those!
When our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick ""sorry"" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat.
As for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.

She showed us the indoor area which is pretty small but very cozy (it would be great in the winter!), she took us out to the poolside terrace which had cabana areas with one fire pit where someone was sitting.  We were extremely disappointed.  

The waitress offered to take us to the courtyard area and have someone start a fire over there for us.  I thought this was extremely accommodating!  So we opted for a table in the courtyard and someone came to build us our own fire!

The waitress then told us that the kitchen didn't know anything about the cider but they had called the head chef and we're going to make it for us.  I thought it was very strange they would advertise something and then not even know about it, but I think they made up for it by making sure we still got it.

I actually ordered wine and a few of the guys ordered beer.  The other members of our party ordered the cider and it came with a splash of rum in a cute little tea cup with a saucer!

Among the group we ordered; bangers and mash (came out cold and we sent it back), the liverpool wings (which the guys said were good and they looved the new castle sauce), the burger, the pulled chicken sandwich, fish and chips and a few orders of fries.

A few tips if you have never been here before:
- Make sure you have a reservation or be subject to dine/stand at the bar.
- Even with a reservation, you are instructed to complete your dining within 90 minutes of being seated. Understandable.

I've seen these all over the country and haven't been back since about 6 years ago so I couldn't recall what the place was all about.

Went last night with a friend and discovered why us americans are the size we are.

Everything is HUGE, and I mean HUGE! However everything is also ""good 'ol American home cookin"" which translates to "" Oh hell yes I'll have another scoop"" 

I had the Goldpan chicken (I think that's right) which consisted of chicken in a sour cream based sauce with red onions and mixed with sauteed veggies, mashed potatoes and a large, buttermilk biscuit.

We stopped by to see the hotel, but didn't stay there as guests. This place wasn't really near any downtown things, but we rented a car so it was no big deal to get there. (If you're flying in for a weekend, I really recommend renting a car- I have no idea how we would have gotten around otherwise.) 

Parking was outrageously expensive so we parked in some shopping center across the street and walked in. It was maybe a 10 minute walk, but you're mostly walking through nicely manicured Opryland foliage so it's a nice walk.

The hotel was a sight to behold- HUGE glass ceilings, indoor river, many, many restaurants inside which had an ""outdoor"" feel because of the massive atrium. We took a boat ride given by ""Delta River Boat Tours"" which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the ""fascinating"" facts about the hotel. She told everything as if it was the most amazing fact that had ever left her lips: ""Here we have the original interior wall of the hotel... it was built in NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN!"" (So old!) or, our favorite, ""Here in the hotel we have an INDOOR SWIMMING POOL, so that you can swim ALL YEAR ROUND"" (You mean, INSIDE the building? Impossible!)

The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us, from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through, the tasting, rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand, got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering, bar, dinner rentals, bride & groom suites, and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready, take photos, have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy.

It is very eclectic with random decor and music.

The bartender was on point and the rest of the staff seemed friendly enough.

I ordered the Big Jerk sandwich and the Caprese, but asked to have that as a salad instead of a sandwich, which they had no problem doing. Both were good with the Caprese stealing the show.

The food:
The Big Jerk was flavorful and the meat was very tender (pork). It was a little on the dry side even tho it came with a dipping sauce. The caramelized onions were a little on the sweet side. The pickle spear that came with it was not your standard ""dill spear"". It is homemade and very fresh, just lacking a little zest, but still good.
The caprese rocked. The balsamic reduction, cubes of Moz, diced tomatoes and sunflower seeds was a winning combination. I will definitely get that again but next time I will ask them to scale back on the size. Way more than I needed.

Now for the good stuff: The house beer, ""Phat Beer"". I'm not big on IPA's or local brews, but this one has won my heart. Somewhere twixt a Bud and Bud Light but with a lot more flavor and a little pinch on your tongue.

The only reason Phat's didn't get five stars was because of the Big Jerk. They need to freshen that up a little.

Footnote:
Phat's needs to upgrade/separate the restrooms. The women should not have to deal with what the men leave behind. They also need to upkeep it on a more regular basis.

I work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option, which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi, especially during their busy hours.

A couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be, and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times, the service was horrible. When you online order, the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is, what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in?

Today I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes, but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee, without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at, asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember, so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her, ""So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?"" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante, and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime, the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt, which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels, and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says. I honestly would have just complained to the manager instead of writing this Yelp review, but I had a 10 AM appointment and had been at the Cosi for 15 minutes and had to run back to make my appointment.

What you don't see mashed potatoes in the description of the dish? You thought that the word ""layers"" meant more than one?  You thought that béchamel was a sauce?  You thought Parmesan cheese usually could be seen or when melted looked like it had been grated rather than an overdone mashed potato.

When I asked the waiter, he said that those were not mashed potatoes, it was solid béchamel, that they no longer put a liquid sauce on the dish.  I asked him why the menu said sauce and he just shrugged his shoulders.   Several minutes later the manager came by, offered the same lame story and offered to bring me something else.  When asked about the potatoes, just looked at me as if to say, you should have known Pastichio has potatoes.

By this time, I was and am pissed off that I was told twice I should have guessed about the mashed potatoes, and that béchamel was not a sauce.

The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.

 Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.
The donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.

The Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.

The caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I""d imagined.

The pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.

The halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.

Believe the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had.",2012-03-01 02:07:58

Really, Trader Joe? Your stores are all over the place in other cities, like Chicago, DC, San Francisco......but southside Indy gets ZERO...downtown Indy NONE. That's not cool, Joe. Not cool at all. 

However, the employees are pretty useful and cool (and sometimes even funny). The food is affordable. I like that it doesn't take me 15 minutes to get through the store because it's petite. LOVE the products. Once I got a spoiled piece of salmon, and they cheerfully refunded me and I didn't have to bring back the gross fish. I like the free samples (last night I had a bite of pumpkin pie). LOVE that I can have a cheese party without going broke. Their low-budget beers and wines are fantastic for cooking and fairly passable for drinking if you need to buy in bulk and your friends aren't super snobby about booze. 

Kefir, non-dairy milks, organic products, cheese are generally much cheaper here than at other grocery chains or gourmet stores. Their frozen foods are very good and the MorningStar Farms sausage links' everyday price is equivalent to the super sale price at other grocery stores. 

I am particularly fond of the somewhat-strange party snacks, although they are much pricier than at Saraga. 

Trader Joe's is a great place to find food to ""cheat"" with if you're not much of a cook or are pressed for time. For example, you can buy an already-seasoned tri-tip to use for your steak fajitas. You can find pre-marinated chicken to put on the grill. They also sell many pre-cooked foods that you just have to microwave...if you can't cook at all. 

In conclusion, start writing letters, people! We need a downtown Trader Joe's! It isn't fair that so many of us (including students, who want nothing more than to eat healthy) have to drive 30 minutes each way to get groceries!",2013-11-14 20:45:33

Location:
Look, parking in town can be difficult.  That is no different here.  I found a spot nearby but I've talked to others that had to walk quite a ways to get here.  Just luck of the draw.  Beautiful gardens and homes to look at (duh) so just enjoy the stroll.  I'm not applying this towards my overall scoring but I'm noting it so you know that I know that you know what the deal-i-o is.

Atmosphere:
Dead silent.  Seriously.  So.  Freaking.  Quiet.  If you need to study then you've found a winner!  If you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot.

When I walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because I made an actual loud noise and it startled them.

Not the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity?  Chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest. 

After I got my coffee from the huffy barista (more on that in the next section because I should really review the product & service I got) I chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness.  That was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone.  In a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church, his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker.  Look, I'm nosy but I try to make it look like I'm not obviously nosy but it wouldn't have mattered here.  This guy really got into it and wouldn't have noticed if the roof fell in.  He certainly didn't notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a VERY PERSONAL phone call.  After a few minutes I gave up pretending I wasn't watching and took in the show.  After ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call, heaved numerous sighs and 'helped' them with the same care he'd given me.  Spoiler alert: it wasn't indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude.  I watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit.  Not really relaxing, ya?

Service:
I asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if I wanted medium, dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me.  If you don't know what you want in the first 2 seconds then they'll just make up your mind for you.  Okkkkkkk.  I watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too.  This guy wasn't really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasn't obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job.  Everyone has a bad day but don't take it out out on the customer to the extreme.  I mean, you don't have to kiss my butt but don't be all huffy and DO NOT PICK MY COFFEE FOR ME WITHOUT ASKING.  Rude.

Coffee:
It was good.  Not great.  Not mind-blowing.  Good.  Not as hot as I prefer but more heat than tepid.  I ended up pouring about 1/4 out because I got some grounds in the finish.

I couldn't find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask (remember, my first time here) and being ignored I just used a straw.  I hate to drink fair-trade coffee that wasn't my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when I don't have to.

Other:
I didn't eat so no word on that.

Bathrooms were clean enough.

Great restaurants nearby.

I really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room, the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch.  Just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snark.",2017-05-13 14:22:33

I do have tattoos and I'm in my early twenties so I felt like the staff regarded me as not as significant as the other guests. I had a couple of rude stares initially and when I visited the executive lounge (which requires a key) for some breakfast I received an almost, ""Who let you in?"" look from the woman serving breakfast. With that said, the room service operator seemed quite irritated whenever she took my orders but the actual room service deliverers were quite friendly, so I made sure to tip them well. Food and beverage could do some work, it's the not the worst but definitely not the best, especially for the price. I had free wi-fi with my stay, so that was very nice and convenient. Overall, I would stay again at the DoubleTree in Center City just because my stay wasn't awful but the staff definitely needs to brush up on their services techniques and courtesies.

This is the third time in a row we've had problems with our meal. The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.

On this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages... 

I ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.

Another steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.

The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.

We will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.

We loved them all, but I was partial to the escargot and the oysters Rockefeller and he to the clams casino, so I did not mind letting him finish the clams while I devoured the other two appetzers. We did skip salads, but hubby enjoyed the wonderful lobster bisque, of which I found exceptionally good, with my one snitched spoonfull. 

My husband had the Prime Rib, what else? I love filet mignon and they have in house made bearnaise sauce, so I stuck with what I love best and it was a huge, juicy and tender portion, very good indeed. 

The restaurant has a lot of class and prices are what you would expect.

We sat at the chef's bar which allows you to see the food being prepared in the open kitchen. It was fun to watch until we noticed that one of the cooks was tasting the food with a spoon then continuing to use the spoon to cook the food. He did this with every dish he cooked, reusing the same dirty spoons to taste, stir, and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty, but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again. I would have said something to the head chef, but he was present in and around the kitchen the entire time, so I had to assume he saw this too and did not care.",2016-03-07 02:25:58

Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. 
The layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.
The food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means ""before"" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee's. 
For our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. 
Our main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. 
We did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso. 
Overall I recommend this place, mainly for the main courses, but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini's their 5th star. I hope I can!",2012-12-04 13:38:42

My wife and I arrived at 8:00pm and was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar.  

For starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!

I had the Calamari Fritti, which was amazing. I am a big fan of dipping sauces and loved that it came with three! I tried some of the others which were the Ariancini, clams, and mussels. All of which were equally good, especially the mussels. Next we split up a chicken ala vodka pizza. It was crisp and tasty. I got a chicken tortellini soup next. It was great and I loved that the tortellini was al dente, and not the mush commonly found in soup. Finally I got my entree, the Pescatore, which considered of a mix of seafood over linguine. I chose the white wine sauce, and it was delicious. Oh, and how could I forget, the complimentary bruschetta and limoncello was the perfect beginning and end to our meal.

I stayed about 1.5 miles from the Convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me. I went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that I felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast. As I was strolling along Magazine Street I peaked in the window of what I thought was a Pastry/Cake/Sweets stuff kind of place. ""BITTERSWEET confections"" For a moment I thought maybe they weren't open yet because it wasn't crowded with a line out the door like others I had passed.  Then I glanced over at the menu and I spotted the breakfast menu!!  I said to myself, give it a try, why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere, you're right HERE dude. So I walked in and that is when my 3 day RELATIONSHIP started!.  Yep, it was so damn good I went back every day on my morning walk to the convention. Day one I asked to speak to the chef, a lovely lady FULL of passion about her food and family recipes. She makes a damn good Biscuit!! I wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal (Healthy Portions) and I didn't want anyone to think I was dissatisfied. She smiled, thanked me and said I'll see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after. I could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day I would find someone along the way who hadn't eaten yet and pass on the deliciousness of the day! It was a wonderful experience.  On my final day my local friend wanted to take me out for breakfast at one of ""THE SPOTS"", the convention was over and I wasn't on any schedule. We walked to the place she recommended (a very popular spot, with a very long line and wait). I said, I can't do this long line, let me show you a spot I found! So we took a nice morning stroll over to Bittersweet. BOOM!, another AMAZING meal, there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes. I overheard them say they were on a budget with a humble look in their eyes. I can tell you from my seat they were treated like a respected customer who had deep pockets.

We had a room in the Tuscany Tower which, even though the decor in this area and in the room was casino-ey over-the-top to pretend to be somewhere in Italy, if they'd revamp the rest of the property to have this look, it'd be a massive improvement, but I realize some people like funky neon space rainbow decor. 

Our room was very large with a huge bathroom with a shower and large whirlpool tub. The room had a tv in the bathroom and in the bedroom with the usual limited cable lineups. The bed was one of the more comfortable hotel beds I've had and we slept very well. The lighting in the room uses expensive dimmer switches and there are a lot of them! It was definitely overkill for a hotel room, but its nice to see that level of effort. Lots of big, dark crown molding and big Italian-looking paintings.

I thought my only solution this go round was to repeat the same overly medicated birth I experienced last time where they told me what to do and I had no say in the matter. I found Rebecca via the web and she came so highly recommended I had to at least speak to her. Her flexibility made me instantly fall in love. She met me via Skype (my request) and was so sweet and knowledgeable I knew she was the doula for me (despite the many others I'd interviewed). From that moment on I've been soaking up her knowledge and leaning on her for support. When I went into labor and couldn't even open my eyes her voice made me so calm Bc she created such a safe soothing space for me, ensuring whispered voices and dimmed lights. She was able to bestow more knowledge on us in that setting than any of the nurses on staff. She is literally a genius when it comes to birth. She has so many tactics and means to provide the best support. She is still my go-to for any mommy concerns. She is always there and always reassuring. Gosh, I love her. She is very affordable and provides so much expertise that I truly don't know why she doesn't charge more. When I had to leave the state for a family emergency within weeks of my due date she found me not just a back-up doula, but also a hospital that does water births. She found me a medical practice that supported my birth choice here in Atlanta. Thanks to her educating me I was able to have the birth I always wanted and didn't know was possible. I am amazed that I did that but humbled Bc I know that I couldn't have done it without her.",2015-09-23 23:28:11

I was impressed with the decor and design of the interior which use to be a church many years ago. The building had it's 100th birthday in March and is located  Mid City in the midst of cemeteries, funeral homes and some residential.

Our waiter Gregory N who formerly worked for a well known restaurant in town was humorous, professional and a native of NOLA. We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.

For dinner I selected the Flounder, fried green tomato, and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberries

What's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption. 

We had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed. I must say that the seafood was the freshest quality and reasonably priced compared to several other high end restaurants we dined at NOLA.

Redemption exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return here next time I'm in NOLA.",2013-05-07 13:54:08

The whole place was rather dead, probably since it was the day before Thanksgiving. Finally, she came over to take our orders. She was helpful in telling us what to avoid on the menu.

The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them.

7lEnBPyy-oeKK9eIucCtqw,XmeGVxnrmnC7bELNfBr-lA,SwBhaxfQPbyhsi0QHUAN0A,1,0,0,0,"This place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive. I'm admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager Ali, who --when I asked why my room wasn't made up despite my  calling housekeeping, stopping by the front desk and activating the green ""make up room"" button -- behaved as though making the bed, cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job. In less time than I spent requesting the service, i could have cleaned my own room. Worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button. A lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on.   

No one knows the hotel policies or amenities and I got a different answer every time I asked a question. 

The binder in the room indicates that I can either use the in-room safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk. When I asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box, they said they had no idea what I was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service. The front desk said there's no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho I was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box. No one has read their own guest binder. 

The binder and literature also says there is a pool. There is not. There is not a even single place to sit or walk outside, and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years. They could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air, since there are no balconies or windows that open. 

There was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third. Had they been providing what they claim to, they'd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green ""make up room"" light had been on for nine hours. I don't really care if my bed gets made, but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door, à call (and voicemail) to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where I was assured the room was serviced, that's just bad management. 


Post script: I was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 9:30 and 10:30 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room. I did not so much mind being awakened by their work, as much as terrified when -- after id dozed back off -- they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for DO NOT DISTURB. I called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where I left a voicemail. It's like no one is in charge of this place. Not hospitable. 

 The gym is decent and security, bellmen and casino personnel were all lovely.",2017-02-09 08:27:22

I'm not a prima donna and saunter up to the bar expecting preferential treatment.

The scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.

The tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)

The popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad.

The Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.

The Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  

The Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.

I am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.

Also side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.

When they opened up shop in Brewery town, I quickly bookmarked Spot and waited for a burger craving to hit me to give it a try.

Spot is on West Girard Ave and I was able to find parking easily and close by on a Sunday night. The space is clean and bright with tables in the front, and back. There is also counter seating. There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.

The people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.

I went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces.

We ordered Bloody Marys and Mimosas and they were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Bloody Mary. 

We ordered the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict and crab cake eggs benedict. They were both so delicious. The crab cakes were huge and full of delicious crab! The poached egg was perfect, I literally almost licked my plate clean. The home fries on the side were super amazing too, the seasoning on it was just enough and had the perfect crunch. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his fried green tomatoes as well. I was able to get a quick bite and I can see why!

No salt in it, no spice, no heat. The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game. 


******************UPDATE***********************

So I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him ""let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus, it was Endymion that night, so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance.""

We sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating, drinking, or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it, I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager, the owner (I think?), and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture, and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared. 

To veer off into a tiny tangent for a second, of all the restaurants I go to, good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there, you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes, you know everything is nuked in the microwave, you order it anyways, you eat, you pay, you tip, you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service, or at least are entitled to, but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point, La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant. 

They changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest, fair, and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor, it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house, and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat, tang, and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.

Have not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet, but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for ""Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist"" as the bartender described it, then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but, rather more importantly, because they care.",2017-03-15 01:54:12

The service was satisfactory. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was not as bad as some of the other places I dealt with in the French Quarter. So I guess it was okay to say the least.

One of the other things I like about this place is the unusual amounts of homeless wino's that pass out in front of this place. I kind of understand that this is the norm on Bourbon street. But it is comical to see a bum passed out in front of an upscale place like this. This place is really pricey, but given the fact it is an upscale place on bourbon street I totally understand why.

Whenever I get ready for a trip, researching ice cream shops is at the top of my to-do list. I don't care if it's the dead of winter. You take coffee breaks? I take ice cream breaks. I realize that I take this obsession/addiction to an unhealthy extreme, as I've been known to eat it for dinner. 

With that said, you can imagine that I was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp. When reading the reviews, I was convinced that Creole Creamery was going to be the ""Bi-rite of the south"" (best ice cream I've ever had). I had some pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not deliver quite like I thought it would but it certainly wasn't bad. 

My main problem is that out of the 3 flavors I had, THEY ALL TASTED IDENTICAL. I got the Basil Coconut & Lavender and my sister got the Rose. These were some of the most unique flavors they offered and you'd think they'd be pretty distinguishable from one another. Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.

What I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can't buy something like this in the store. Had the flavors wowed me, I would have given this 5 stars, hands down (and it truly would have become the ""Bi-Rite of the South"" in my book).

All in all, I will definitely go back. I mean, it's still great ice cream. And I'm sure if I tried a more traditional flavor, the taste would be stronger. I just really love the weird stuff :)",2015-08-06 21:43:28

First off, the service was very polite and helpful, recommending some excellent dishes.  I had the tortilla soup, which had everything under the sun: tortilla strips, avocado chunks, sour cream, cheese globs, other good stuff that I don't even know about.  My brother got the cheese soup, which was really good also.

I also had a shrimp quesadilla, which was really delicious, due to the spices they put on the shrimp,  nice blend of pepper and other unknown spices.  But the cous de gras, was the chiles, stuffed with shrimp, wrapped in bacon, and sitting in a soy sauce-esque liquid.  UNBELIEVABLE!

Rittenhouse Square is just a few steps away and that's where I go to eat my lunch.  The lady sitting next to me on the bench remarked how good my food smelled.

 Everything on the menu at Hip City Veg is vegan, though even if you are not vegan/vegetarian I would recommend it because the food tastes really good!

I liked the Udon noodle salad with faux-chicken. I've also had the ziggy burger which I thought was pretty good for a veggie burger (loved the fresh tomato, lettuce and onion) but especially enjoyed the sweet potato fries I had as a side.

There are also some interesting drinks. There is a ""groothie"" which is a greens and fruit smoothie. Personally I thought it was just OK and not that thirst quenching, but it seemed like a lot of people were ordering it so I tried it.

I ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.

We had the grilled shrimp - very tasty with garlic and olive oil. 

The black paella was delicious - no fishy taste even though it used squid ink. The portion size she said we would get was not as large as she made it sound so if you are a crowd get two.

The battered and fried garlic was amazing - meltingly tender pieces of mellow garlic.

The pork belly was amazing - slightly crisp exterior and yet soft and supple with a rich flavor.

The beef tenderloin with port sauce (?) was very flavorful and best ordered in multiples it is so delicious.

The fried cauliflower was not greasy and had well developed brown notes. 

The Pudin con caramelo for dessert was terrific with a rich caramel sauce. Hot and crusty on the outer edges but a tad cool in the center. Have them cut it in half before they warm it so it is warm throughout.

The tavern used to be an old stagecoach stop back in the days people used actual horsepower to power their transport, and the original structures seem to have been kept intact from those days. The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant. 

We were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their ""fancy"" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty! 

The prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.

I took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones.

Once downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Just a hodgepodge of tables and chairs, some random booth seats and a bar. No decor, nothing that gave you the specialness of being in a private space. Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement.

Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless.

The Carne Asada in general is excellent at this restaurant. Their shrimp is excellent and their tacos are good. Honestly I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves, which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa, plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice, and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.

It's definitely not a fancy restaurant, so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere. But it's clean, neat and extremely relaxing inside. So if you're looking for good Mexican food, this is definitely the place to go!",2013-07-12 20:38:40

Pretty standard as far as hotel beach resorts go -clean rooms, fairly large (2 queen beds and a couch/sitting area). A restaurant downstairs that serves lunch and dinner buffets (but it wasn't that good, didn't even soak up my alcohol!) and of course the shop where you can buy way overpriced flip-flops if you forgot yours.

Now for the Tiki Bar: large, actually two bars plus a stage area. Overlooks the bay and boats can anchor up here and enjoy the small beach front or walk up and have a tiki-drink. I can't say anything special about the drinks- they weren't specially strong and even for the holiday there was no ""special"" drink (like how about a ""memorial mai tai""?) 
Although there were a good many people there you could still walk around, dance if the notion grabbed you and *bonus* they had misters so it didn't feel too hot (not good for my lobster-lookin' body right now though!).

We came between brunch and dinner, so ate at bar. Had a bottle of the ""best pizza wine""'and liked,it. Ordered two pizzas for the three of us. Plenty. And I eat a lot of pizza.

Pizza reminds me very much of Vetri, and similarly priced (expensive). Excellent ingredients. The style has a soft middle crust, almost white and underdone (to me) which apparently is authentic. Otherwise I would ask for a little more well done, but that might be an insult. You tuck and fold the middle to eat.  I mean, it's delicious, but I feel I shovel too much in that way and lose the individual taste of the fabulous toppings. The outside crust was  puffy and tender.

Nice bartender service and he was really runnng around. I think it was a surprisingly busy day downtown. The gelato is always amazing. I'm in a rut.

There are so many delicious flavors to try and it's usually hard to choose just one.  However, over time and many flavor tests I find that I tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors.

The donuts here are imaginative and original. I had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning. 

New Orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while I didn't get a chance to try the one at Wink's in the French Quarter, I imagine the ones at District are a good representation. It's a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally, I'm more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen, no sweat. But there were other items to try. 

District has ""croquenuts"" available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the ""Monte Cristo"" for it's sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.

Finally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso, olive oil, and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful. 

Not to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down. It was the jolt I needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts.

I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table.  I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant.  I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.  There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly.  Not the servers fault.  The portions were huge!  I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day.  I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned.  I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet.  All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.  While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends.  It was an enjoyable experience and a good value.",2016-09-06 00:57:55

The donuts looked overdone and loaded up with unnecessary ingredients at first, but I was wrong.  They were actually well balanced with good flavors.  They take coffee seriously too.

The place looks like an old cabin from the outside, and as soon as you enter the door, the first things that you'll notice is the dim lighting and the real fire in the fireplace, crackling away. There is a super old rustic feel to the decor, and the bear hide hanging across the wall really completes this place as an old rustic tavern for weary travellers...but in this case, it was more for locals and tourists. 

The food was interesting as we ordered the rabbit, the elk, and venison meats! To my surprise, nothing was gamey and the meat was actually tender and juicy. 

This was definitely a good experience and as many others have mentioned, it is a good place for a romantic date and/or it is also good for a group of friends to hang out and relax.

I ordered a specialty flavor-- ""The Wizard""-- which was chock full of brownies, nuts, I think, and strawberries.  The medium size was bigger than I expected, and it ran me about $5.00, so next time, I'll go for a smaller size.

I like Mr. Wizard's, and I'll definitely be back.  I like the casual neighborhood feel, the thicker, different taste of the custard, and the fact that the location is right.

My partner and I went here twice during our trip. The first time was great. Bar was busy, but we snagged a spot to stand and got great service. Between the delicious cocktails (peanut infusion is a real treat), the upbeat music, and friendly patrons and staff, we thought we had found our spot for the rest of our trip.

The second time was much different. Although the bar was pretty empty, the two bartenders ignored us after our first drink order, chatting up and serving other patrons, but letting our drinks sit empty for over 15 minutes, despite our efforts to catch their eye. It appeared they'd determined middle-aged patrons were a better source of tips and saved their charm for them. When one server finally checked in with us (asking abruptly if we were okay, not suggesting another cocktail or anything to make us feel welcome), our mood had been soured and so we passed on the second drink we'd been planning and moved on to Batch up the street, where the cocktails are just as good and the bartender was happy to serve them.

Sad to offer a less than hearty recommendation because our first trip here was so great.

I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.  

I ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.  

If you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be ""politely declined"" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle.

On saturday I went with a group of 7 people. Since Honeys is one of our favorite places to get brunch, we knew that we would have to wait up to an hour for a table. Since they have such good food, it's worth it.

But this is why I'm no longer going to go there, and the reason for the two star rating:

The hostess was horrible. There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave.

After the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8? 

I understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea, but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table,and then sits 3 people, that is the dumbest thing ever.

The doughssants! Or cronuts, as some people prefer. How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They're very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup.

We entered the restaurant and we were told to seat ourselves. We looked at the menu and the prices were very reasonable. We ordered our meals.  Our meals were huge!

Afterwards, an older couple asked the same question about being seated closer to the tank, and their wrinkly old butts were escorted front and center. Ageism at its finest! In the end, my wife and I and the old couple walked away with relatively the same experience though because the food was awful. Don't order fish. You will be treated to a large hunk of dry protein that has no taste and is topped with cranberries. Remember Thanksgiving at Grandma's house? Large overlooked dry as f turkey that you had to choke down with 8 glasses of Sprite? Bingo. Rumfish Grill.

I appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free (even the bar) before the smoking ban went into place. They keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle.

They prefer if you start out with an appetizer or something, because the sushi is made to order, and depending on how busy it is (every table was occupied at noon today), you'll have a bit of a wait for it. The lunch was $9.99 per person. I don't know how you can possibly beat that! I did not care for the ginger dressing on my salad. It tasted quite bitter to me. I also didn't really care for my tempura banana. It was more of a texture thing for me. Once a banana gets heated up, it gets very mushy. Everything else was delicious.

We were visiting Nashville and an internet search for restaurants showed this was one of the places to go to in Nashville.  We went for brunch.  I had a good feeling when we first when in and Zeppelins Over the Hills and Far Away was playing but that was probably the most memorable thing.  We didn't start off with the whippped feta, which seems to be the big thing there, maybe that's why we didn't have the same experience as other people.  I ordered the French toast cinnabon thing which was fine.  My wife however, had the Shakshuka and did not like it at all.  Too spicy in the morning, and as someone mentioned in another review, it would have been nice if that was mentioned (although it does say spicy on the menu, I think she was expecting a different spice).  Also, the poached egg to me was disgusting.  My wife used a spoon but could have drank it with a straw.  I think there were two, I give her credit for forcing down one, I couldn't have done it.  We also ordered a bloody mary  and a mimosa.  There wasn't much mimosa as far as volume goes and my bloody mary was a little thick, I think because of olive juice.  We each had side orders of bacon, two slices each at $5, and not like it was super thick.  Overall, the bill was about $80 and my wife was still hungry.  The waitress did notice that my wife hardly ate anything and mentioned getting the whipped feta saying it would help her stomach which was now hurting because of the spice.  She said no, but it would have been nice if the waitress had brought over a sample.  Anyway, like I said, about $80; $10 each for the mimosa and bloody mary, $14 for the three cinnabon french toast, $13 for the Shakshuka, $10 for four slices of bacon and whatever it was for the coffee (which was good).  I'm counting the tip so the coffee must have been up there too as well as the extra pita my wife asked for.  Listen, The Olive Tree Cafe in the Village in NYC has been there forever.  Check out their menu online and check out their prices.  They don't do breakfast, but if you're ever in NYC and get a chance to go there, do it.

Really what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries, coffee, tea and went to sit down, the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm, this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this, I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.

sVMZ9sgBqM7yEgOh2-OUZA,B3It8nvQKHgxZwCxgsh43g,w0lcP2ngFaUpBGi5yzlYDw,2,2,2,1,"Summary: terrible value, unreasonable wait times, extremely inattentive service staff, and perhaps worst of all, smooth jazz. 

When I read some of the reviews on here, I feel like I must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else. My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.

Now, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That's it.

The staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn't know when we'd see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn't make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.

The ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren't showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don't really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I'm eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist's waiting room.

The food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a 'bowl' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it's organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn't go home hungry. And that's exactly what I did. 

The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.

Obviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn't recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends.",2016-01-04 05:53:55

We immediately addressed it with the manager - firstly, a check should never be presented with gratuity added unless it's a party of 6 or more.  Secondly, automatically adding 20% is just rude.  Fact of the matter is, we probably would have tipped 20%.  The managers response was weak.

It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called ""salad""--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.

And, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors. 

Overall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy.

There were only two seats available at the bar and when we asked the bartender if there were any extra available seats he just told us, ""what we have is what we have"", and kept on doing what he was doing- he didn't offer any suggestions or apologize for not having enough seating. Throughout happy hour when we ordered food the bartender barely made eye contact or acknowledged us he simply would barely nod without saying anything and at some point he slammed my friends beer down. Eventually I said something to the manager and the bartender warmed up but by then we were done with our night there.

The chocolate was ok, but the mousse has a horrible RANK taste, and SMELL as well.  It tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  It wasn't one of those things that taste like something, IT WAS SPOILED.  Even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!

The pound cake was ok, nothing special..  Needless to say, the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return again!",2013-06-24 14:28:06

The food is pretty good (appetizers somehow always being the highlight), but it is always SUPER crowded. Like, constantly apologizing to your neighbors for knocking elbows crowded. The tables are very close so that they can fit everyone. This also makes it difficult to carry a conversation

But the main reason for only 2 stars is the SERVICE! I've come here for lunch about a dozen times and they always push the buffet, which I understand, but they are VISIBLY annoyed when you don't want it. It's so rude! Last time I came here it was with 8 people, and the hostess asked if we were getting the buffet. I told her I didn't think any of us would, so if we could please get menus. Her face immediately changed, she said ""oh..."", and handed me 3 menus...for 8 people. When the waiter came we apologetically asked if we could have some more, and he pretty much had the same reaction! He rolled his eyes while turning to get more, and just dumped them on the table.

Something similar to this has seriously happened almost every other time! I get that the buffet is easier for them, but come on! It's not asking for anything crazy, just MENUS! At least make an effort to hide it until you get into the kitchen...",2013-12-29 06:38:12

The dumplings of the day were Pork and Mung Bean, and they were decent.  The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned, but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil, it was quite tasty.

I also had the burger, which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar, but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun, and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors, but was still a burger, a well cooked one, at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.

I got one of their specials, the bacon turkey burger and fries. The burger was good sized for a lunch portion. After eating it, I was full but not stuffed. The burger itself was well seasoned. The turkey was light but hearty enough. The bacon was mostly good but part of it was not as crispy as I like it. It comes with all the fixings. I got fries as my side. They were perfectly cooked.

Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice, casual dining experience.

The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich, she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time, so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable.

As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place).

The one that really sticks out is the squash blossoms - do not miss this one even if trying new food scares you. They have a texture and flavor similar to a delicate bell pepper, and they are perfectly tempura battered and stuffed with tangy goat cheese with a little honey drizzle.

We had originally booked our swamp tour with Dr. something or other and they were horrible so we jumped ship (no pun intended) and booked with Cajun Encounters. I am so glad that we did! 

We opted to take the bus from NOLA and was glad that we did. Our driver was so-so and he attempted to give us a tour from town out to the dock but sadly it was lacking (this is why I am deducting half a star...you will see why the other half star deduction...just keep reading). I think there was a language barrier and that kind of sucked. Oh, and he was 30 minutes late. That was a little frustrating. We took the first tour so this meant I could have spent an extra 30 minutes sleeping. Boo!

Once we got there we checked in and it was rather chaotic (the other half star deduction). You walk in and see a long line for tickets. The bad thing was that it is in the center of the gift shop. That made shopping rather difficult. This is probably not a good thing for revenue. The dumb this was that there was a register in the back...which was closed! 

The tour itself was great! Our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable. I really enjoyed him. He gave us a history of the swamp and offered tons of info about the elusive gators of the bayou. We saw a number of them and even got to hold a baby. How awesome is that? Let me tell you, it was pretty darn awesome! I highly recommend that you request a covered boat.

Some of the special ones in my memory seemed to reflect the love that the people running the place had for their small establishment.

Hendel's is that special kind of place.

When a coworker convinced me to eat there for lunch, I thought, ""Where the hell are you taking me?!"" as he turned off Lindbergh onto some seemingly random local roads.  I found myself in an area untouched by the familiar quazi-ghetto strip malls that I felt personified Florissant.

Eating outside is a huge recommendation on the patio with the well tended garden and the overall cozy feel of the place.  The service is friendly and the food is very good, but nothing spectacular.

While you wait for your tour you can grab a bite and beer and roam around the lobby or chill at the Biergarten - an excellent outdoor spot.  On the way out we visited their gift shop and bought a growler filled with any beer of your choice. What sets these growlers apart? They're thermos- so they keep your beer cold for 24 hours!

I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu. 

My first bit of advice is, if you haven't been before and want to know what to order, the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal, and it is quite filling, has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs, a big slab of ham, two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese, some delicious bread and a salad, all together on one glorious plate. My fiancé and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip, I also ordered the lamb sandwich, which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom, drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding. 

Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do, it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that, there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen, go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly, this was really touching to see. 

I couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon!",2011-02-14 22:08:53

I lived in Tampa a long time and got to eat a lot of Cuban food. I'm excited to have another Cuban place here in Indy. There aren't many. 

When I think of good Cuban food, I think of Cuban bread, yucca, plantains, pork and cafe con leche...just to name a few.

Today, we got the Cuban sandwich and the plantains. They were both really good. The portion size of the sandwich was huge. It could easily be shared. The pork and ham were good.

There were two big misses. The biggest miss is the bread. It's just not right. It was almost the consistency of a cracker. It wasn't bad, but ALL of the Cuban bread I've ever eaten was much better. Even if it's pressed, I've never had cracker-like Cuban bread.

Cuban bread is something that I would order as a side, I love it so much. This bread missed the mark.

What did disappoint me were the grits and the gravy. The grits were gummy and the gravy was kind of like paste with a hint of chlorine. Things that should be easy to make but just not good. The biscuit wasn't   bad but even it was a tad strange being more crispy than I would expect.

Went for with our family and friends, table of 7. We were seated quickly, service was prompt. Orders were correct. We had 3 burgers, pulled pork, Mac n cheese and the kale and cheese dip between all of us and not one of us was disappointed. Great food. Fries were crispy but not overdone and burgers were delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice and juicy. 

Beers. Great. Tasty. My wife had a taster and all were really good. Neither of us are stout fans but it will still good and we both loved the IPA.

I first found the Manayunk location, and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.

Eventually I tried the University City location, and it's much more ""hip.""  I really don't care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.

Han Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.

On their ""specials"" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.

They have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.  

Dry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.

Several reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.

We liked the idea of ordering a bunch of small plates to share.  It didn't disappoint--everything was delicious and lovingly presented.  We ended up ordering the goat cheese and basil bruschetta (mild but tasty); figs stuffed with blue cheese and served over prosciutto (rich and pungent); calimari (which I didn't try); fennel sausage (tender and flavorful); two of the cheeses (one was an amazing triple creme; can't remember the other one); and the chocolate torte.  The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.       

It's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant, which we had anticipated.  The bill came to $80 for five small plates, a cheese board with two cheeses, and two glasses of wine (i.e., a moderate amount of food for dinner for two people).  You could obviously tweak this depending on your appetite, your budget, or your mood.  It would be a great place to just drop in for a snack.

My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back.

I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions, therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page, where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee, but fails to mention the $18 parking fee. 

This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice, if not better, for far less.

I ate at this restaurant many years ago when it first opened and it was not impressive, which was strange as we used to dine in the old buffet which was across from this one, and that was always 4 to 5 stars. 

I didn't eat here for a long time, then heard it was good again, tried it and agreed. I ate here 2 more times and both times were 4-5 stars, that is if you got the dishes that always look the best and the ones you like.

Tonight really was impressive, we were quickly sat, and served, I went out to get a plate and saw the mushroom ravioli and decide to load up, I got about 8 to 10 of them, and most places that would be all you get for $18 (probably a couple less raviolis too), but then I added tortellini, a small serving of lasagna, a loaded baked potato, fresh medium rare prime, and grabbed my seat. Everything was 5 stars, even the potato was excellent! 

I was sufficiently stuffed, but it's kind of pricey, so you got to dig in and go for the uncomfortable stomach for a couple hours, so I grabbed another plate, and loaded up crab legs, mussels, and peel and eat shrimp. Again, all 5 star dishes. I was very shocked to have so many different dishes on such a high level! 

Service was great, all plates quickly cleared, server was available anytime for drinks, napkins, etc.

I used to live a half a block from their 22nd Street location, but even now that I'm living outside of the city, whenever I do make a trip in, Pure is a MUST STOP for me.

Everyone who works there is so genuinely kind, and always tend to their customers. There's none of this texting behind the register crap, they are true professionals! They have a fridge full of the most beautiful, exotic flowers that you can purchase by stem. I always pick out a small bouquet for myself from there and they'll arrange it for you along with some free greens, wrap it up in this beautiful black paper and tie it off with twine some form of seasonal decoration.  

When you first walk in you'll see a bunch of arrangements that were already called in and waiting to be picked up or delivered, and they always look fresh and beautifully arranged. This place has some of the biggest roses and peonies you'll ever see, as well as some exotic flowers you just can't find anywhere else. They have vases and other small plants for sale as well, and during the summer the outside will be lined with planters and hanging ferns for you to peruse before entering the store.

I'm just totally obsessed with this place, they've got it together on all ends and I am constantly recommending them to others! If you're looking to really wow someone with a bouquet, this is 100% the place to go to.",2017-05-13 17:46:15

SO where would you eat if it was your last lunch of a great NO trip?  Hard to choose, right?  Wrong!!  We went to all three and were not disappointed in the least.  I suggest you do the same.  
Start at Lukes and split the $16 dollar burger kinda pricey but very tasty.  Then Walk over to Red Fish Grill and eat  two orders of their BBQ Oysters (you'll feel cheated if you get just one order) with an Ice cold beer. Now realistically that should be enough for lunch but its only fish, not too filling? 
Now onto Deanies to sit at the bar and eat these amazing shrimp, however, I'm not sure what was better the shrimp or the loaf of French bread to dip into the butter with and washed down with an ice cold Heferweisen on tap!!! My God was it satisfying. I haven't felt that satisfied since my ""first time""!!! Screw the calories I'm in Nawleans! Now I think I know what a junkie must go thru when he needs his fix.

To get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing?

Ambiance:  I have stated before in my reviews that I absolutely loathe it when restaurants rely on big screen TVs for entertaining.  They assume that the majority of people really give a crap about sports.  I don't and I find it really distracting.  The Cheese in Cheeseburger must really mean CHEEEESY DECOR.  Seriously, fake hula skirts on the wait staff?  

FOOD:  I almost didn't want to come here because I remember people saying they charged you for soda refills.  We were not, so they must have changed their policy.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  The meat itself was pretty good, but I didn't like that the bottom of the sandwich was soggy because of the cole slaw.  We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer which were excellent.

It's right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officer.(I think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time). Let's just start with the donuts. They r amazing. They have the best donuts around. I love donuts so I have been to just about every donut shop in the Nola area. And these r the best!!!  The donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want. All U have to do is ask. Whenever I want special orders I call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon. The apple fritters here are so good as well!!!  Red velvet cake and Reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the Oreo donut is just as good!  Next let's move on to kastleburgers... These kastleburgers are a New Orleans original and no one can top them. These people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science. ( or so it appears). I have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastee's kastleburgers are so Much better. Does anyone even go to crystal?  Also just like the donuts you can Special order the kastleburgers. They are always made  fresh. The breakfast is so good as well. They use real products. It is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast. U can order anything u can imagine for breakfast. I have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and I have seen all different types of breakfast platters served. They also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 24/7. Now the hot plates they serve here are so good. They have everything and it's all home cooked u can taste it. It reminds me of when I was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice. They also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it.  The gumbo is good as well. All I can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full New Orleans style donut experience. This is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when I was a child it's so nice to have a restaurant/ donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product.

I have been here for breakfast & lunch (Marlton & Cherry Hill)  and both times I have been here the food has been spot on!! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food!!  The food is fresh, unique & not greasy like some diner food in the area. I recommend the Marsala Eggs Benedict very good & different and the Benedict sauce was tasty just wish the sauce was a little warmer. I like my poached eggs juicy 1 of the eggs was over cooked for me. I would recommend telling them how you like your eggs cooked. Overall a great place for sunday brunch!! Also don't forget the champange for mamosas!!   

The wait staff is also great!! Very accommodating without the hidden charges!!  They asked if we would like any of our drinks in a to-go cup.

Turning Point I recommend that you serve the Marsala Benedict in the big spoon serving dish like the others benedict dishes that is a great way of keeping the sauce from the potatoes & everything all on one plate",2015-02-02 15:08:02

I'd urge everyone to look into the costs up front, so you don't have any surprises on check out. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. 
Dinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. 
There are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6"" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms.

Usually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don't feel like I'm over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. 

After confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him ""no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?"" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small.

They are a triple(yes triple) chocolate cookie.

Every year, when the WUSTL department I'm in is trying to recruit new graduate students, we hold a social event here for the prospective and current students to mingle and get to know each other better.  The two years I've taken part in this event have just been a blast.

The Schlafly event room in the back-- I forget the name of it, but I think it has one-- is just a fun and unique place to have a private event.  The view of the Bottleworks is impressive, and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great.  I think the cost is pretty reasonable for us, too, which includes unlimited beer/wine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors d'oeuvre.

I'm a member of the group that helps put the event on this year, and I definitely think we're sticking with the Bottleworks again.  Look forward to an updated review around February or March next year!",2010-05-15 13:58:00

as for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm, it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out. 
when we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins, his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil. 
when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said ""I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing"" and that ""they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing"". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted. 
i felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated, like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they ""miscounted"" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps)

Here at Vanderbilt for a class, and kept passing by the Tavern on my way to campus each morning... Had an inticing, rustic, downtown Manhattan look to it. So I put it on my list of places to check out. I looked here in Yelp, and saw it had great reviews. 

I came in for dinner tonight, and immediately noticed the reclaimed wood door, wrought iron, and alternative rock playing. I knew it would be a great place. I sat at the bar, as I was here by myself, and immediately got a menu and was offered a drink. I had the 1920, which was a little stout, but better than weak, am I right? I ordered the lamb tacos, Tennessee tavern fries, and cinnamon roll bread pudding. Tacos were small, but honestly a decent portion considering how much meat was on them. They were hot out of the kitchen, and the roasted peanuts gave it great crunch. Now, the Tennessee tavern fries ... Sweet potato fries with a touch of cinnamon and sugar, with jalapeño ketchup. Shut the front door, these were to die for. Light and airy, arrived in a mini frying basket with abundant portions. The ketchup was amazing, and I definitely asked for more. The cinnamon roll bread  pudding was a muffin size portion, with vanilla ice cream, homemade whip, and caramel sauce. Great flavor, not overwhelming. 

Service was fantastic, and even met some fun people! Highly recommend this place. I'll be coming back for sure.",2014-01-17 01:08:16

All the choices make it kind of hard to choose. I'd like to see them pare down the menu a bit, focus on 5-10 burgers that they can really do well. Some of the choices are so similar too that I don't think it'd be hard to edit  a bit.

Everyone was raving about the soda choice but no Cheerwine? WTF? Maybe Cheerwine really doesn't exist outside of the Carolinas. There was a ""Carolina"" burger on the menu (suspicious that this would really be Carolina style i.e. w/ pulled pork, vinegar sauce, and slaw on the burger, but we'll have to see) but no Cheerwine? That just doesn't seem right.

The ice cream was also delicious. I got a salted caramel shake with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Every bit of it was delicious, especially the chocolate sauce. Next time might need to get a sundae just for more of that sauce.

I'm very bad with the names of pastries, but I can say that I definitely like the Guava turnover, bearclaw, almond croissant, and ham and cheese croissant.  I wish they had more savoury pastries, actually I wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit. 

I had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning, grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work. Later on in the day I would grab a loaf of bread that I would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast. I wish the bakery was open later, but unfortunately, none of the bakeries in New Orleans are open late, and by late, I mean past 1 or 2 pm. 

That being said, the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and I would give this place more stars if it wasn't for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers. I have been frequenting Maple Street Patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions I have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient, even when there's no one else in the store, or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate.  At other times, the workers are actually pretty nice.  So please, if you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers.

If you want coffee, I would go across the street to Starbucks or down the road to PJ's, but if you don't mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakery.",2012-05-28 23:39:44

As far as hotel connected restaurants go, this place isn't too bad at all. They have a very nice setup, with sections far enough apart so that the restaurant isn't overly loud when the bar is busy. The staff are usually very friendly, and keep your drinks filled. The place has a great atmosphere and can be a good spot to catch a ball game. Some of there specials are tempting, especially when they have half priced starters.

The food here is about what you would expect. Efficient, hot, served quickly but nothing that will knock your socks off. I'd recommend the burgers and just about any of the fried dishes. Most of the starters are good, especially the wings. The BBQ is passable, but nothing to get excited for. Certainly aren't many good alternatives for BBQ in the area, so this place could definitely do the trick. Just please beware that if you're dining with a large party, your BBQ will likely be a bit on the dry side by the time it comes out, happened on multiple occasions. If you're there with just one or two other people, then you won't have to worry.

Bottom line is that if you're staying at the Holiday Inn that this is connected to, you can get a decent meal, some good drinks with a nice atmosphere. Good without being great, but never slid into bad territory. I'd probably lean closer to 3.5 Stars, but not higher than that.",2012-10-08 19:22:15

Did not get a full meal. Drank a tall Budweiser, and overall had fun with friends. I do prefer sports bars with a less corporate feel, something more like Ferg's is downtown St. Pete.

My friend scheduled this tour in advance for my group of 5 our first night staying in the French quarter. Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA, going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour, the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone. 

Anywho, the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour, they probably just weren't paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter) 

At the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour, she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours, you won't regret it! 

One more comment about the negative reviews, you'll notice a couple people say it's boring: it's not! It's a 5 in 1 tour that lasts 2 hours, there's a TON of history to go over and if you're chatting or not paying attention you will miss all of the stories!",2016-03-07 06:16:35

My favorites are the sugar and spice because the syrup is something out for this world. I also like the chocolate chip because they drizzle the chips on top.

Being in a large party in a busy restaurant, you expect things to take a bit longer than normal. We were fine with that, given that this place came highly recommended.

We were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back. 

Around this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.

We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury, though, the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.

One person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told, ""we're busy"". Yes, restaurants get busy and food may take a while, but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say, we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.

It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review, but this is definitely one of those occasions.

My first experience with a pet boarding facility was a few years back on another location, when we decided for the first time (and only time in 11 years) to take a vacation without our dog.  My parents were out of town and could not babysit, so we did the boarding thing,

After that experience, I vowed never to board my dog again, and it had nothing to do with the boarding facility.  The facility was awesome!  I paid for a private ""suite"" that had a TV tuned to Animal Planet (I am not kidding) and had a webcam so I could check up on my baby over the web.  Well, after spending most of my vacation glued to a computer screen hoping to catch glimpses of my dog doing stuff, I decided he was coming with me on every vacation from that point on.  

When they opened up a Preppy Pets near my house, i was intrigued by the suite and webcam options and we decided to check them out.  Their place is top notch, and if for whatever reason I couldn't take my dog with me, this would be the only place I'd even consider leaving him.  They also have outstanding grooming services.   McKenna is their groomer, and she has magical hands.  She makes my baby beautiful every single time!   We used to have our dog groomed at Fluffy Puppies but switched to Preppy Pets as there was a certain procedure that we needed done each grooming that Fluffy Puppies wouldn't do.  It has something to do with the anal glands, and I'll leave it at that. :)

Surprising since it was a busy, holiday weekend so you'd think they be turning out lots of fresh pork instead of a product that tasted like it had been sitting under a dry heat lamp for hours. However, wings were pretty darn tasty. A touch under done but worth coming back for. Ribs and pork are dead to me though.

The biggest disappointment about our recent visit was the way the ""wait in line, order, get your number and sit down"" process soooo doesn't work at this place. To be fair, it's not Mr. Edley's fault that the douchebag hipsters and self absorbed yuppie parents don't have enough common sense or courtesy to not sit down before they've ordered and obtained a number but seriously, PUT UP SOME SIGNS or have the bus people and manager politely ask people who have rudely tied up a table (or 3) while their party waits to get up. When I suggested to the cashier that they might have an issue this past Saturday, she said they ""don't allow that"" but then nobody told the family of 8 who committed this major foul to get up while we looked around for a place to sit (after ordering, of course). 

My thoughts for Edley's 1) your food quality is slipping 2) your customers apparently need to be taught that sitting down before ordering throws the whole balance of your system off--find a way to tell them.

P.S. If you're a party of 10 and looking to sit together on their patio on a busy night, go somewhere else unless you're prepared to respect the system and try your luck for a table...AFTER YOU'VE ORDERED!",2014-05-26 01:19:47

- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.

- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?

- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.

- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.

- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.

EDIT:

- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.

- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.",2014-01-17 21:10:17

Mad Crab met my expectations and then some. The ""whole shabang"" (aka: whole shebang) medium and mild seasoning was amazing! The half dozen oysters tasted beautifully fresh and the staff were gracious in my requests for salt and pepper and hella limes.

I think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And, if he/she doesn't like cajun seafood, you know they're not the one!

My advice to the management, if they read reviews, is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition, consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.

Overall, well done and I'll be sure to recommend Mad Crab to my Saint Louis friends.",2017-11-07 01:35:50

Employees of both the hotel and casino were friendly and helpful. The weather cooperated and didn't rain. If it had been a few months later we would have been knee deep in snow! That would have been interesting, right? We rented a car and my wife signed me up to drive the single ladies back and forth from the hotel to the vinue and back. Thanks honey!

I was convinced to try out Edley's when a friend in town billed it as 'unique and gourmet BBQ'....OK, I'm not sure exactly what that means, but what the hell, I'll give it a whirl!  I like good BBQ, but I LOVE good Nashville Hot Chicken, and that just jumped out at me on the menu.  So, I throw in my order for a hot chicken sandwich....I was mildly alarmed when I was told that it only came in one level of hotness and they couldn't give me any hot sauce on the side (they did offer wing sauce).  Despite some mild reservations upon this discovery (what kind of REAL hot chicken place doesn't offer some type of 'this will kill you from the inside out' level of spice?), I pushed ahead with the order.  Damn, I AM a brave man.

We sit down and the order comes out just a few minutes later.  Here we go...after de-pickling it, I dig in.  First thing I notice is the breading: not as thick as your 'standard' hot chicken, but full of flavor.  I actually liked it better....seems lighter (but I know it's not more healthy, I'm not kidding myself on that).  The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly.  The spice what a LITTLE on the light side, but still had enough heat for you to know it was there.  

Anyway, I am a HUGE fan of this place....great food, full bar, nice set up inside, and a great patio as well.  Throw a great location on top of that, and what else could you ask for?",2015-07-04 02:19:18

Service: Meh. everyone there seemed really bored and the vibe was a bit bland. 

Seating: I sat at the counter because I dislike communal seating unless I'm at a bar. I recommend this option if you don't want to sit near someone else's hangry toddler or if you just want to watch the pizza making magic.

Food: Decent. The pizza (I got the Crudo) was good and rotolo was really good but my pizza was a bit too oily and was barely warm. Other then that, the thin crust style pizza was well executed and all of the ingredients were fresh. The prosciutto wasn't overly salty and the sauce was lovely.

It isn't like the servers are slow either, they are clearly working their assess off running from table to table, so maybe it is that people have called in sick the couple of times I've been in recently and they had to work twice as hard but a Sunday lunch shouldn't take 3 hours.  

Now that my complaining is out of the way, the restaurant itself is super groovy.  The kitchen is on full display so no crazy stories of chefs putting anything crazy into your food here.  And they look like they are having a great time while they prepare meals (whether they are or not, I love to see people enjoy what they do).  I normally get draft beer but their cocktails look really interesting and innovative.  

At lunch, I normally get the ""Goodness"" which is a hummus wrap and it comes with a choice of a side ($8).  Don't bother being wishy-washy on the side, get the Asian slaw, it is delicious, and if available I would order as a meal.  The wrap was good but the star was the slaw.  Thai, pea-nutty, goodness:)

I've gotten the Elvis before ($8) and it was delicious but something I can make a home.  I ordered it without bacon.  

My husband ordered the burrito and loved it as well ($9).  Others at our table raved about the Chicken and the Pig, The BBQ pork, and The Cure sandwiches.  Everyone really liked their food.

Surrey's is allegedly the best breakfast in New Orleans. Yelpers talk about it like it will change your life.

I don't understand, and I never will.

I've eaten at Surrey's three times in the past year, and each time my order has been borderline inedibly disgusting. I have eaten there with multiple dining companions, and they have all, to a man, in each instance found their own meals to be borderline inedibly disgusting. I've started to ask people I know, ""Hey, have you ever eaten at Surrey's?"" They always reply, ""I hate that place. The food is awful.""

I will offer an example. The huevos rancheros deluxe. The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were, in my most generous interpretation, over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality, smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do. The lox had (surprise!) apparently been marinated in some kind of lime mixture, plus had been heated, possibly sauteed. The whole thing was *covered* in capers. Take a moment to imagine these flavor combinations. And it cost $13.

And so do the other guests, which makes this place so fun: the last time we were there we ended up joining booths with our neighbors so that we could all talk about the restaurant and their liquor choices. It's a very cool, very like-minded crowd.

Food wise you can't go wrong with duck fat french fries. I feel like I don't even need to say that, because come on... duck. fat. french. fries. We also go for the cheese puffs on their late night menu as well: a hot pan of ping-pong ball sized bread balls coated in cheese and broiled and delicious and... oh boy now I'm, hungry.

And if the other reviews aren't clear enough... their burgers will have you singing hymns of praise to the meat gods.",2012-10-09 16:45:19

The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  

Prices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.

One last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).

Both plates were good, but nothing struck a chord. There should be something you tell your friends with relish or with venom. There should be something that sticks out about a place.

You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine. 

We made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an ""early lunch"" slash ""snack"". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.

The quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!

It was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.

My wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist.

Formalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.

Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty.

My friend got her food on a separate ticket, and awhile went by, and I still had not received mine.  It took a little longer than usual, but I figured it was because they were so slammed.  A few minutes later, the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table.  She asked if I had gotten my food yet, and I said no, and she apologized and said she'd be right back.  Then Bryan Haas (I'm guessing he was the manager at the time), came out with our food, apologizing.  Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff, and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay, and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary, but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there, which I thought was very professional and sincere.

I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask ""do you mind if we sit here.."" and was cut off. He said, ""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours."" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why ""that man was so rude"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same.

The first time I walked in, I had a lot of long hair that I knew I wanted to get rid of.  I wanted to go short -- not bob short, but short-short.  I had a few pictures of cuts I liked, but  no real idea of what would look good on me.  I sat down with Ellen, we chatted for a bit, and she soon suggested a style that I thought sounded promising.  And it ended up being more than promising--it was fantastic!  I loved it, my friends loved it, and even my family liked it (high praise).  It's a cliche to point out, maybe, but i got more compliments from strangers on my hair the months after getting it cut than I'd heard for years prior.

I eventually decided to grow it back out, and kept coming back to V Vegaz and Ellen for trims and cuts along the way.  I think we can all admit that growing hair out from above your jaw to below your collarbones is going to take a very long time and be irritating no matter what.  However, working with Ellen made that a far less frustrating and a far more flattering process than it would have been otherwise.  

As for more general things, the atmosphere of the salon is lovely--very well-designed without being intimidating or cold.  I never had any trouble scheduling appointments, and, thanks to the receptionist Michelle's help, was even able to fit a trim at the last minute when I accidentally showed up to the salon on the wrong day.

If this wasn't the sweet haven of amazingness between furry monsters and sweat, I really cannot attest to what the heck a sweet haven is. 

I ate steak, delicious steak, instead of a grilled cheese at Elmo-Bites. Because I found out that Elmo can really bite. He is a monster after all. 

The servers are so great with kids and yet you sit in that swanky dark mahogany bar atmosphere and feel like you are human again after a day at Sesame Place. I actually think JB DAWSON's is the reason we went back after our dinner. I downed my steak and two beers, looked at my adorable 3 year old who was quietly coloring on the kid menu they have, turned to my husband and said, ""Wanna be parents of the year, and take her back to see the parade?"" Swiftly, he responded, ""Let's do it. Go big or go home.""

All the waitstaff works together here too. I don't know if they pool tips, but it's like some sorta family feeling they give you as if the waitress' big brother just took over her shift so she could go help mom in the kitchen. So rare to find fast, efficient, and dependable hosting like that in a restaurant these days. 

Being from New York City and eating at an array of places over the years (with plenty of annoyed waitstaff), this place reminded me of Gorgios of Gramercy in terms of atmosphere and service. And it was child friendly which always scores well with me.

My only constructive criticism: my newborn has a dairy allergy and an overwhelming majority of the dishes and sides have butter, milk, or cheese in them. They made me a beautiful plate of steak, but all the higher priced sides I was supposed to get, I could not have. So I paid the same amount for two less filling sides....basically steamed broccoli (which was actually amazing) and fries.

The solution was not ideal - the order of dishes was off, we did not really want the extras, and the ""champagne"" was horrid, but it was New Year's Eve and we wanted a pleasant evening, so said fine.  Most of the dishes were excellent. However, our final tab did not show the promised deduction.

This was previously a review that provided a less than desirable rating for the Peppermill.  I am writing this as an amendment to the previous review (below) and changing its one star rating, as I was contacted by a very nice gentleman in management (Dave).  Through him, the Peppermill has taken a very large step in an effort to change my opinion of itself as ""the premier resort"" in Reno. Dave has helped to restore my faith in the resort, its management and the people there. We will update again after the next stay

03/01/2012 (original Review)
I try not to bash anyone or anyplace!
Ok, well I surprised my wife with our first alone getaway since having our son 3.5 years ago. I booked on the phone a room with a spa tub, mountain or pool view and 1 king bed, got a confirmation # sent by email. 
We got there and they gave us a room with no tub (not romantic and not cool) so we go straight back to the counter.
They inform us they cannot give us what we ordered as there are none left. Why the hell do we book rooms and get confirmation numbers then, what a crock. 
So they are able to give me a room on the ground floor with a grand view of a nice fat brick wall, 2 beds and a bath. How charming a view of a brick wall, these guys really know how to make good on a reservation for our first romantic getaway in years... 
As this is what they have, we kind of have to take it or stay in our current room, so we take it, big mistake!!!!!
It is late so without checking everything, we run to get a bite to eat. After a late dinner we come back to the bedroom and I pull down the bed covers, to my amazement there is a big fat hair on my pillow. Great now I have to wonder if the room is clean or not. 

Guess what, they have no other rooms left so we get the hairy deluxe room. 

I waited 4 days before posting this as I left comment cards with the Peppermill and was told the manager takes these things serious and makes things right. I have not heard anything as yet, so am posting this review. 

For the ""premier"" place in Reno, this is sad. I would rather stay at a place that provides what was ordered and is clean.

So much for my surprise romantic getaway - If they contact me I will update this review",2012-03-01 16:52:05

I'm sure there are varying opinions on this, but I'm in the boat with the people saying I thought D&B was Chuck E Cheese for adults. Little kids everywhere. I don't mind gaming with teenagers, but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place. There's people with strollers taking their infants. People, please go to Chuck E Cheese.

I guess there's an any-age policy at the whole chain, it's just not what I was expecting. If anything, they should make it adults-only (or at least 13+) on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends. I know that banning kids would cut into their customer base, but this makes older people not want to go, so pick your poison. I thought adults were the target market but that's not even close to the truth.

As far as the games, I didn't see anything for more than two players. I don't know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years, but way back in the day you could play some with four. 

The best I saw was a downhill ski racing game, where you stand on it and steer with your feet. Cold air in your face for added effect. 
The Walking Dead game was pretty cool. Kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time. ....but I guess they're not going for realism in a zombie game. It's just a license for marketing, it's a generic zombie game. No show or comic characters. I don't care either way, it's not a bad game.
There's a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race, and is connected to other machines at other locations. My friend and I were in tears laughing at this, since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose. We just picked whoever looked most likely to cry.

There are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones, but overall I actually had fun. Not sure if I'll be returning unless I find time to go when school is in session. However, I guess that wouldn't stop two year-olds from being there.",2017-06-06 19:00:15

When we arrived we were told they were all gone and had to get a room with 2 doubles (not even a room with a single queen). This was upsetting since in my book the whole purpose of a reservation is to get what you paid for. 

Once we settled for the 2 doubles the guest services told us a lot about activities and local food. 

The room was in great shape and clean. I am giving 3 stars for the reservation issue.  I was going to give lower but guest services had great services and even though there is an issue with the beds it is a nice room.",2016-06-12 01:25:50

-QQKeWd-H6zHKqwjd3fU5A,mfgXV_EDtCSky-_EuCQrrw,U3aNQ5DsABPYyJQolsCbJg,1,3,0,0,Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible.,2017-01-15 04:11:08

That must be the $26 burger that I didn't have (mainly because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, and I didn't want to be ""that guy"" to ask for a different cheese) because the Village Burger was good, but not exceptional.

I got the ""Village Burger"" (8oz, Sesame Roll, Tomato, Boston Bibb, House Made Thousand Island) with bacon and provolone (+$3). It was huge, could hardly fit in my mouth huge, and delicious, but I don't think I can call it the best burger in all of Philadelphia.

The duck fat fries were great. They were big, crispy, and hot on the inside. I'm going to get the sly fox cheddar sauce with them next time.

The whiskey list is HUGE. 

It's so small inside they don't have ""sections"" for the waitresses (or it might have been because only the bar and outside seating were busy). There's the bar that seats maybe eight people, though I didn't count (it was full), four or five booths (completely empty at 5:30pm), and a little counter that seats five or six in the back (empty as well). There's more seating outside than inside. After paying one waitress, another asked if I wanted another beer. I'm not sure if it's a plus that there's always someone checking on you, or a negative because they're unorganized? 

 I'll come back, but my main goal will be to try the extensive whiskey list, not a burger.",2016-08-03 23:22:56

yNAmr9WPJjC05wTXiIap9A,4Uh27DgGzsp6PqrH913giQ,Y3ZCO17N1_T_Ms1JmswwzA,4,2,5,4,"During my visit last week, I ate so many shrimp tacos I couldn't walk. In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. 

During dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: 

Tortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. 

Shrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. 

Sauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. 

Beans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. 

Horchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. 

Pina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade. 

Taqueria Pico De Gallo, come onnnnnnnn. Why so good?",2011-08-25 03:46:43

This place has taken a massive backward step since my wife and I use to frequent the location often while she was in hospo at Ruths down the road...The girl at the bar was a completely unprofessional.. Essentially asked us to leave and gave no reason. When we asked for the bill after 1 drink she knew she was in the shit so much she crossed her name out on the receipt to avoid detection (3 times despite us asking specifically for her name and a full unaltered receipt for my records) she  kept  giving us torn off versions  without her name or the name of the place) 

We visited after a cards game. I had taken my team out to celebrate wins at our organization and I was shocked at how my team was treated. No sooner had we arrived - 1pm - with [ 9 ] people , we were given the cold shoulder... The door says open until 3 am  but it was like the girl at the bar resented us for arriving.... 
Dark hair girl: was so rude she basically told us she didn't want to serve us. Everyone was happy but no-one was drunk.. She was extremely rude and short with everyone. We had chosen to leave PBR to Calicoes because I like the place  ?!? Weird...
The police man [ Willis ] at the bar was professional when we complained but said he could do anything,  even he seamed perplexed by the dark haired girls attitude...  Even the other bar guy was saying she should chill.

It's a huge location with lots of stock and the majority of the friendly staff seem to know the layout pretty well and can easily direct you to what you are looking for. If for some reason they don't have it then they will call another store for you and get it put on hold. They have good deals on gifty knick knacks as well. I was surprised to find they offer the best deals on Pop Vinyl figurines which I am an avid collector of. They also have a large selection of the gifts for the home (e.g blankets and vases) if you are into that sort of thing.

Made the mistake of coming in for a drink on the balcony on what happened to be Saint Patricks Day - albeit it was fairly vacant.  First time I've gone to the bar to get a drink and there was no one else waiting, just 2 people sitting at the bar, already served.

The bartender upon our arrival says she'll be right back - given we were ordering a sauv blanc and an iced tea, could have easily given our order prior to her departure.  She then left for over 10 minutes (during which time a manager or some other employee came behind the bar but made no acknowledgement of us, or attempted to take our order)...and then upon return, did not apologize, but asked if we've decided what we want...well, i decided prior to you leaving, and i sure as hell hope within 10 minutes I'd have decided on one drink!

She then took the other people who had accumulated's orders prior to serving our solitary glass of wine and one iced tea...and she asked if it was for here or to go, after taking out the glass. I said ""for the balcony,"" (AKA NOT TO GO), and she switched it out with a plastic cup. Given $9.50 for a house sauv is greater than nyc and London pricing (and the cocktails are actually less in most cases), I would say that it could warrant an actual glass, to remain on venue - which we mentioned..and she stated that they were short of glasses given it's ""saint pattys""...well, I'm sure you have a dishwashing machine. Regardless, she at no point said thank you, and was quite rude throughout, enough so that I truly regret my frequent visits, and one of us complained (about the cup, not the delay and rudeness) to management (however, had I complained, the rudeness would have been my primary issue, not the cup).

To note, the balcony was 100% empty - for the first time I've ever seen, so no, they were not busy, also evidenced by the lack of patrons at the bar.  Even at the point we left, there were only 2 more couples, whose orders she took prior to serving us, so not exactly a complete rush for which she would be stressed...nor did she go tot the restroom, so not sure where she went for 10+ minutes.  

Having been a server, and having brought many, many groups here over the years, and visiting multiple times every visit to nola, I found this pretty disappointing.  

That said, I'll still return, if only for a drink on the balcony, and hope there is a different bartender.",2015-03-18 23:23:27

Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey Bruschetta - this was my husbands favorite bruschetta - it was also very good!

Roasted Beet Salad - loved it. There was A LOT of goat cheese, so if you don't care for it as much, then ask for them to go light on it. I love goat cheese myself, so it worked out well. It was light, but there was enough to make lunch filling.

Claudio Mozzarella Sandwich - 4/5 stars - really tasty. He thinks it would have been better if the prosciutto weren't crispy since he felt it lost some of its flavor.

I ordered the Princess with an egg on top. Trust me, hot chicken and eggs for breakfast is a gorgeous & delicious thing! I devoured the entire meal in very short order.

One breast piece was fairly small, the other was a chicken finger smaller than the wing.  Given the size of the wings and drumsticks, the breast from this chicken should have been 8-12 ounces.  Not 2!  The coating was burnt.  Not pleasantly caramelized, just too overdone.  The sides (which are $4.50 each) were paltry.  Like an ounce and a half of brussel sprouts (what we subbed for the potatoes).  The mac and cheese was runny and tasted like raw flour from and undercooked roux.  See the photos.  The picture of the wing is next to the ""breast"".  For $30.  Don't be fooled by the apparent fawning the local press does for a known chef about this place.

The sauce was spicy and divine. 

It's worth the wait.

Most recently, I went with my father to try the croissants and lavender latte. The lavender latte was way too sweet. I liked the lavender taste, but the extreme sweetness ruined it. It was still too sweet after I diluted it with water, so I threw the drink away.  The croissants were okay (too dense for my taste). They had good flavor, and somehow tasted better the day after. I liked the stuffing of the spinach feta croissant, but the croissant itself was too dense and not buttery. The ham and cheese croissant was delicious. The Nutella croissant was okay (good flavor but the croissant was hard and didn't have enough filling). The butter croissant was too dense with texture more like a bread roll rather than a flaky croissant. The almond croissant lacked flavor.

In the past, I've ordered a green tea latte (that I hated- it just wasn't a flavor that fit my preferences) and a mocha (that was good).",2017-07-28 21:30:53

They claim to serve Mexican and Texas food, on a somewhat authentic basis. This is not true. I've never seen plantains on a taco in a Mexican restaurant in Texas. Also, Texas barbecue is largely smoked brisket served sans bacon in a sandwich. Or taco. Simply having Texas toast and Tequila (albeit a fabulous selection) does not make you an authentic Texas or Mexican food establishment. And plantains certainly don't. 

Plus, their customer service hasn't been good after going there three separate times. Each time and shift, the manager has been dismissive and the waiter or waitress has been over-worked. Which is why I wasn't too upset that after 20 minutes of having no ice tea refilled, I wasn't upset when I got attitude from my waitress when I finally saw her to ask. She looks at me and says, ""I was going this way to get his water ('he' didn't ask her a question, 'I' did) and I'm going the other way to get you tea.""

Ok dear, well maybe if you'd checked on us previously you wouldn't be so upset, now would you? 

But above all of this, plantains, though good, are never on a chicken taco and then passed off as ""Mexican"" food. They're good tacos. And that's ok. But poor service is not.",2015-04-28 19:47:47

It's changed considerably.  i don't know if the food quality dropped with the economy, but even their burgers are failing.  The only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries.  (It was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor, just like char is supposed to taste).  Their oysters are good if you're lucky enough to get there on a west coast day, but even then, they seem to get the small batches.  
A real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters.  A real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that.  
Oh, and who took the doughnuts?  Really?  Of all the dessert items, you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce?  For shame!

I heard such good things about this place and since we were checking out a band next door last night, we thought we'd go in and try this local soul food restaurant people have been raving about.

I went in with a small group of four. We stood by the door waiting to be seated for a good 5 minutes. But no staff was in sight. So we thought maybe this is one of those establishments where you seat yourself... So we did.

We sat close to the front and waited. Finally, a waiter came into the room. He looked right at us and kept walking - OK, guess we're not at his station. We waited again. Another waiter came in, she acknowledged us, but never came over. A third waiter came in - we must have been seated for 15 minutes at this point and still no service has come to the table -- not even to give us a ""I'll be right back"" explanation - he apparently wasn't our waiter either.

At this time another couple walked in - it looked like they were deciding whether they liked the place (it has a ""dive restaurant"" feel to it). One waiter sees the couple and points to a table for them to sit at. The couple still talking amongst themselves did not see the waiter signaling (why didn't he just walk up to them? Makes no sense). The waiter says, very loudly and rudely with an annoyed tone and expression, ""heeelllloooo!"" When they heard that, they left... And so did we because still, nobody had came to our table and we didn't want to miss our band because of some sub-par waiters who were struggling to handle a half empty dining room.

Of course once the elevators were back up I was a little scared to ride it up to our floor but I did fine. The common areas of the hotel were nicely done, very classy and the room was nicely decorated, up to date, and we had a partial arch view. Same day but much later.....our room wasn't cleaned when we arrived after being out the whole day  so we were a little disappointed in that but all it needed was to have the beds made so it wasnt a big deal. Our second night I will have to say I saw an influx of people, seemed like a lot of college or baseball fans, one or the other. That night we were woken up by someone pounding on a door and shouting to be let in, I thought someone was surely trying to break in. It was our lovely neighbors who were having some kind of lovers quarrel, three guys trying to get back in their hotel room and a mad girlfriend not letting them in or something along those lines. My bf went out and set them straight and they left. Well I finally dozed off and again we hear this damn pounding loud enough to wake us up, I guess guy is finally allowed in but I still call front desk. Third time woken up is when security knocks on their door and they come out and speak so freaking loud I wake up again. Fourth time I hear a large group of girls and guys shouting. laughing, and interacting with the idiot next door. If it wouldnt have lasted less then a couple minutes security would have been called again. The rest of the night was fine but dealing with this definately put a damper on my night. The next day when we checked out we explained the situation and security had the info to back it all up. We were given a credit to one of their restaurants so I appreciated their effort since they didnt have any control over their rowdy guests.

No longer a fresh face here on M Street and long ago rid of its growing pains... This restaurant is officially my new ""go to."" 

They DO NOT charge per glass of ice tea. My first time here, apparently, was simply the victim of an inexperienced waitress. 

I ordered the chicken piccata (amazing) and my husband ordered Wagyu Filet (and I stole a bite).

My husband, quite the connoisseur of steak here in the gulch- having eaten at Watermark, Adeles and Sambucca- has declared this steak: ""Best in the Gulch!"" 

He asked that I quote him in this review, so here goes ""It's my 'perfect' but 'perfect' is relative. To be more descriptive it's cooked true to order, excellent flavor, very tender and much better than your average filet."" 

I am so very glad I gave them a second chance. Even having the manager personally reach out to us in effort to right a wrong speaks volumes about this restaurant's quality and customer care. 

This is a ""must try"" for all gulch residents and all who visit.

My friend ordered the Greek frappe which was creamy and delicious, will definitely get that next time. Got the Shakshouka which smelled amazing and was hearty and rich, especially since I opted for the additional sausage. Was pleasantly surprised by the peppery spiciness.

Since all of our meetings have been later in the day and catered, we are given lunch, but we have had to go on our own for breakfast/dinner each day. Tuesday was our first stop in at Café Beignet (311 Bourbon Street). To no surprise, this place was jam packed and we're guessing that most of these people here are tourists (after all, this is Bourbon Street and we are from out-of-town ourselves). 

All of the menu items are less than $10 and are all very tasty. I had the Cajun Hashbrowns on Tuesday and loved them so much that I returned again this morning to have them again. The ""Southern Breakfast"" (eggs, grits, bacon and bread) also looks good, but the hashbrowns had me coming back for more. They are loaded with Andouille sausage, onions and peppers and served with a side of scrambled eggs and bread. 

Had never sampled a beignet (NO-style donut with powdered sugar) and ordered one to go with my breakfast. Then another. And a third. Holy cow, these things are addictive!

The coffee is good as well. Hey, we're from Minnesota and we like good, strong coffee.

My go-to order at Anthony's Coal Fired is a large Proscuitto and Onion pizza with the proscuitto baked (they can either top the pizza with after it's cooked or bake the proscuitto with the rest of the pizza). The saltiness of the procsuitto mixed with the fresh parmesan cheese and sautéed onions is the perfect combination. We split this between two people and always have a slice or two left over for breakfast the next day. If we only have one slice leftover, watch out.. it's a race to see who gets the last piece first!

Let's talk about the baked wings.... really, really, really good. I actually didn't get them for the first time last night and the first thing my boyfriend said to me was ""no wings?"".

On a plus, they had Dragoons beer on tap so we didn't have to endure Mexican beer. All in all presentation was good, staff was attentive, food needed more spice and flavor, ditch the chipotle salsa, or offer something else. If they offered a better salsa I would give a 4 star instead of 3.",2016-05-07 13:55:46

For a Tuesday morning, we waited about 20-30 minutes (No line at 12 pm). There were 3 of us and we all were so excited since it's our first time here. I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes with a side of hash brown. One of my friends ordered the Rash Berry Pancakes , which he complained was way too sweet. The other ordered Pig in the Blanket (pancake wrapped around a sausage), which she ended up eating the sausages only. The pancakes were very average and plain, definitely not as good as what people said it to be. Hash-browns were average also. Personally, I prefer hash-browns at Bongo Java. The portions are huge and I recommend sharing it with someone. 

For that amount of waiting time and mediocre food, I wouldn't come back unless I'm around the area. Not worth waiting at all.

The last time I was here was as a kid - now that I'm older I can appreciate the place for its waterfront party atmosphere. The place had a huge crowd and plenty good-looking people mingling, while some DJs spun the latest hits. 93.3 hosted this party and as usual it drew crowds beyond the typical Clearwater Beach and holiday crowds. Make sure you get there early to find some good parking.

The drinks were made well - packed a punch and although the waitress had a bit of an attitude, we did feel a little bad for her with so many party animals around. The drinks had plenty of alcohol, although they were average to expensive in pricing. I would probably pre-game before heading to Shepards. I saw at least 4 people pass out from drinking during our visit. We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door which is perfect walking distance from Shepards. 

Catching the sunset from here was awesome and the mini-beach made for some great photo opportunities as well. The nightclub called The Wave seemed pretty cool as well, although we only sutck around for short time. I will certainly be back for future partying.",2012-05-28 22:15:04

We had one of the worst meals & I spent almost $180.00.
We sat outside, which was charming, except  we felt  lucky when the waiter showed up at our table. He was rushed & apologized for the lack of wine choices.
The bread was wonderful...
The Osso buco was hard, dry & so salty it was inedible.
Sent that back, the waiter was nice about it, brought back the Scallop dish which was still oversalted &  really bad. 
The side of grilled, Burnt, slimy asparagus was also salty & over cooked. And I truly wanted to send it back because it was horrible....did I mention cold?
But we were starting to get in a hurry to leave so we could wash out the bad taste in our mouth.

My chicken dish was better than a microwave one from Big Lots, but the chicken was chewy, rubbery, 4 sure Not Organic, Farm Raised... Must be steroid chicken , no taste, and I cannot remember the name of the dish, I believe it had a few morsels of pasta with it.  Ughh...

The 1 star is for our waiter , he was OK, but I am SO OVER egoist, affected, waiters telling me about their view on wine, when they obviously have NO clue.
I mention a Gaja Barberesco & he suggests the Amarone. And he continued with a Soliloquy on all the names of Top Italian Wines he knew & 10 minutes go by &  Guess what, they did not offer 1 of the them on their wine list!  So he wastes time trying to show me He Knows wine's names, but Timpanodoes not carry them.
 The Beat thing I orderes was the cocktail I had in the beginning with Elderflower liquor, a splash of soda muddled mint &  cucumber. That was so refreshing.
 My associate polished most of the Wine choice off her self. Which was good and was priced ok, I think the bottle was around $40.00. 
Their wine list is minimal.
 We expected an Italian Restaurant but it was more a New York Steak House.The food was ordinary, over salty, waaay over priced. And don't get me started on the Duo they booked 4 entertainment...
Bottom line, That area of Hyde Parkis in construction & renovation so STAY AWAY. Wait 4 Goody Goody 2 open! That is something that I hear will be worth the parking hassle!",2016-06-22 23:02:57

While Indianapolis is a relatively old Midwestern city, the IMA's history is recent; it was known as the ""Art Association"" until 1969.

The recent multi-year renovation, redevelopment and expansion of the Museum and grounds created an entirely new experience for art patrons.  Let's all say our condolences to the Krannert Pavilion's Brutalist architecture of the 1970s and hello to a somewhat uninspired series of camera-ready atria that will no doubt allow some very impressive parties.

The collection itself is conservative and unprovoking.  Highlights include Robert Indiana's iconic masterwork (and trademark-infringed) ""LOVE"" painting and sculpture, a beautifully painted though incredibly ill-placed Rembrandt, a decent Hopper, an encyclopedic Asian art collection that is one of the best in the country, and the largest collection of JMW Turner drawings outside of Great Britain (although quantity does not trump quality).

I thought the gift shop was as poorly stocked as the previous one.  Not a single postcard of the new museum's exterior, yet there were plenty of old postcards showing the now-demolished Krannert Pavilion.  And for an artwork that's been copied, dubiously appropriated and downright stolen, why was there not one postcard available of Robert Indiana's outdoor ""LOVE"" sculpture?  And what about museum merchandise based off its own artwork: scarves with motif from the museum's Tiffany piece, jewelry pieces mimicking something from the Asian galleries or pop-up note cards laser-cut with the new museum facade?  Sure, all the ""LOVE"" stuff is nice, but capitalize on other museum strengths.

This is a wonderful museum that has a decent collection.  The parking is free, the new eating options are terrific, and there are other fun attractions on the museum grounds, most notably the Lilly estate, Oldfields.",2007-12-12 09:15:32

I had a kedegree platter for brunch, and the rice was seasoned full of life and the veggies and fish were both extra fresh!

I was walking back to my car from ACME, when I spotted a fisherman who was parked and selling his fresh shrimp catch to a chef out on the street.  I took one quick look at his catch and found the most wonderful looking jumbo shrimp I had ever laid eyes on.  Not your standard jumbo, but real JUMBO.  Huge tasty looking shrimp!

I was compelled--even though I had just gorged myself on chargrilled oysters and a po'boy--to inquire about these shrimp of his.  I asked him, ""excuse me, sir, where is the absolute best place to eat those shrimp of yours around here?""

His answer: ""Mr B's, you have to try the BBQ shrimp there for sure""

Who dat?  Mr B's dat.  My convinced my coworker (which wasn't to difficult) to come with me to try the BBQ shrimp.  We quickly sat at the bar, as we had already eaten lunch, and requested an order of BBQ shrimp to share.

When the shrimp came to us, and we took that first bite (after peeling the shrimp, of course), we found ourselves in decapod heaven.  They were served swimming (no pun intended) in a delectable buttery/spicy sauce, which was truly amazing.  The smokey and spicy flavors of the sauce were infused into the shrimp, which is truly no small feat.  The best part about a sauce like this is that it seems to build in nuance and intensity with each bite.  Each shrimp, as a result, seemed better than the one just before it.

I was so amazed, that I returned the very next day for another order of BBQ shrimp, to be split with a different friend.  I take great pleasure in sharing the things I truly enjoy with friends, and what better way to do that than over a bowl of BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's?",2010-10-06 08:18:12

Luck smiled on my party of three, as we snagged a last-minute reservation at noon (you should plan further in advance than we did). I echo other reviewers' sentiments concerning the decor at Kanella; as I walked in, the antique exposed brick and blue/white color scheme tempoarily transported me back to the Cycladic Islands. Chef Pitsillides kept the illusion going with his typically Mediterranean hospitality. He checked on our table thrice to make sure we felt welcomed, and indeed the constant attention and care we received has earned Kanella a return visit on that merit alone.

That isn't to downplay his Cypriot fare; the food is absolutely delicious. One can only indulge in so many variations of french toast or eggs benedict before growing bored, and Kanella's vibrant, rustic plates certainly enliven the palette and restore one's faith in brunch. We commenced our meal with the obligatory dip trio, which served up pumpkin-feta, spicy tomato, and white bean dips in lieu of the stereotypical hummus and baba. Each scored high marks from the table, with the pumpkin cruising into first with an interesting briny-earthy-sweet interplay. 

Other dishes ordered included the baked duck egg, potatoes with tzatziki, and a special lamb tongue stew. Though small in portion, the duck egg showed deft execution with a crispy but ever-so-slightly-creamy fried egg crowning well-seasoned, toothsome greens in yogurt sauce. The potatoes had a similarly crisp texture with fluffy innards, and paired beautifully with accompanying minty, rich tzatziki. The tongue stew offered a heaping plate of creamy giant beans and tender, pleasantly funky lamb tongue pieces in a vibrantly flavored sauce. With a squeeze of lemon juice, a dollop of accompanying Greek yogurt, and a last-minute side order of extra grilled pita, the dish served as a hearty, memorable combination of flavors and textures.

For a change of pace in the Philly dining scene, or simply for Chef Pitsillides welcoming demeanor and crazy-good plates, head to Kanella and get whisked away to the Aegean for an hour or so.",2013-10-15 18:34:34

My son and daughter tried it first and loved the food so my husband and I dropped in last Sat. night to try it out. We sat at the counter and before we even sat down, the proprietor was at our elbow asking what we would like to drink. Saki and beer came back to us by the time we sat down. I ordered edamame and a Crystal Shrimp roll. My husband ordered the tempura Shrimp and Vegetables.The first thing I noticed about the roll that it did not have a ton of rice rolled around it, in fact, it had a very thin layer of rice which was nice because I was able to taste all the ingrediants without fighting through a ton of rice. The roll was delicious! Next my edamame came--hot, perfectly cooked but the dish would have been enhanced with more salt, I think. After my dishes were out and eaten, my husband's shrimp and vegetables came. What a delicious dish!. The shrimp were perfectly cooked with a miasma of light, not greasy, delicate batter. And the portion was healthy--at least six very large shrimp. The vegetables were perfectly cooked! Again covered with delicious batter. The tempura sauce was a little thick and candy like. I would have liked something a little lighter to match the delicacy of the dish. To avoid picking at my husband's dinner, I ordered another roll (and another Saki!). I took a gamble with the long roll ""Why Not"". It was a perfect gamble. The filling was tasty with a subtle brighteness of lemon about 2 secs after you started chewing....a surprise that kept me going back to experience it again with each subsequent bite. 
 
They do have an all you can eat menu. We were not that hungry and ended a la carte. Walked away feeling nicely sated (not  bloated with rice). We would definitely come back again! They have a punch card that offers you freebies after so many visits and you eat FREE on your birthday!

As for the food, they have a really good selection and reasonably priced. The cheese curds are great and the Bavarian pretzel is ginormous.

The entrees are good from meat, seafood and pasta selections. It's an American standard fare and they put some spins on some items such as their Americanized orange chicken who his actually pretty decent with their jasmine rice.

Let's be clear: this hotel is in a great location, is attractively decorated, with friendly staff.  However, for a hotel advertised alongside better-known premium hotels (e.g., Ritz-Carlton, Omni), this was a disappointment, most notably in the quality of service.  Clearly not worth the rack rate or as much as neighboring hotels in this class.

1.  Maintenance problems.  When I arrived, I was initially assigned a room whose door did not close.

2.  Understaffed/poorly trained.  The front desk staff said he would send someone to evaluate the above problem.  After an hour of waiting and repeated calls to the front desk, nobody showed. I re-packed my belongings and had to go back to the front desk to request a room re-assignment.  The staff told me, ""Sorry, we're having a problem with our engineer."" I wish they had just re-assigned me without wasting my time.  I missed the events I planned to attend that night.

3.  Unhelpful staff.  I asked to extend my reservation (made through an online bid) one day, and the staff told me I would need to (a) move rooms and (b) pay the rack rate.  I made another online bid and thankfully moved to another premium hotel, at a lower price than my bid for The Saint.

4.  Lacks amenities.  This is one of the very few hotels in the area that considers itself premium but lacks a pool, hot tub, or spa.  Additionally, while other hotels in the class typically have a doorman, this one never did.

During my stay, I relayed these comments to the hotel guest relations staff. Per an emailed auto-reply, she was attending a training conference (and thus could not address my concerns).

I did like the blue hallway lighting, flat-panel TVs, free wifi, pod coffee makers.  I stayed 4 nights in April 2012.  The text of this review is also posted on tripadvisor.com.",2012-04-28 22:43:37

The three beers I tried to order last night were Sierra Nevada, Sweetwater 420, and Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink these beers regularly draft and bottle and I am very familiar with them. 

I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it came out flat and warm. My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy, orange colored, spicy smelling blue moon. 

We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead. They where also flat and warm.

The manager said their must be a problem with the draft system and offered us bottled beer instead. I ordered my standard choice of Sam Adams figuring it was a safe bet.

He returned  with a brown bottle with NO LABEL and quickly put it on the table without saying anything or apologizing and walked away. When I took a sip it was one of the same flat warm beers that came out of the draft, I couldn't quite identify it, but it wasn't Sam Adams. I realized that they had filled an empty bottle with Sam Adams. When I realized this bottle probably came out of the recycling I stood up an left. I'm still deciding if I'm going to call the Nashville Health Department on Monday. 
 
I understand mistakes happen, and so I was polite and patient with them. In return, I've never been more disrespected by any restaurant or bar. Any other place would have thanked me for pointing out the issue and taken care of it.",2012-04-28 20:16:08

I was told by all my Philly friends that I had to go here for crab fries when I was town.  Friday night during the Phillies game we went to Chickie's and Pete's, we were immediately seated at a two top table.  While delivering our beers and crab fries, the server asked us if we were ready to order.  We explained that we would be there for the game and we were pacing ourselves and her response was ""the whole game, well you better be constantly ordering if you are going to take up my table.""  I totally understand her concern, and we assured her that we would in fact be ordering beers and food throughout the game.

A few moments later she walked through her section complaining and cussing about the $1.00 tip she received from her table, again, I understand her concern, but there is a time and a place.  She then cleared a table and came to take the order of the people next to us, and placed the dirty plate of shrimp peels on the table, gross.  While our beers sat empty she sat down a few tables near us and had a 10 minute conversation with her friends that were dining there.  Another table sat down and again we heard the same speech about not talking up her tables and that they had to order all night (glad it wasn't just us).  At this point, our beers had been empty for 20 minutes.  

My friend went over to the bar, found 2 empty chairs and I asked her for our check.  She knew we had planned to stay all night and asked why we were leaving, and I was happy to tell her that we were not going to take up her table.  Our check was $14.00 and I left $24.00 hoping that she would take that act of kindness and extend it to the poor patrons who had to deal with her next.

Now.... Onto the experience at the bar... TOTALLY AMAZING.  The bar staff that was working on Friday 4/19/13 made our night.  They were friendly, informative, suggested what yumminess to order on the menu!  Over all, those 4 gentlemen negated the unfortunate experience on the other side of the restaurant.  

The food by the way... the crab fries... yum'tastic!  My friend ordered the ""red"" mussels and I had the ""bleu"" mussels.  I feel like we ate all night long and never put a dent in them.

Some people have no clue how to eat Vietnamese food.  Lilly's is packed for lunch,  I've definitely never seen so many white people at a Vietnamese restaurant, and a good many of them seem clueless about Viet food but determined to eat it nonetheless.  That's a spirit worthy of admiration.  Now if they would actually try a bit of the sauce instead of eating plain dry vermicelli, or use the soup spoon when they eat pho, they would get a lot more out of the experience.  Perhaps the server should explain a bit or have a quick intro written into the menu. 

I was glad I got the vermicelli instead of the pho, which did not look appetizing.  The vermicelli was good.  But again, compared to other cities, the food is about average and a few dollars overpriced.  But you would be paying for the clean and modern atmosphere over the sticky floor and tacky setup of your average Viet place.",2013-01-28 05:14:45

The major problem I have with Bottleworks is the inconsistency of the food.  Some days, it's solid and satisfying;  I love the multigrain (including quinoa)  pilaf they have available as a side.  Other days you end up with burnt dried out beer bread and poorly seasoned food.  I never know what day it's going to be, so I am wary.

First off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip
Ordered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.

When Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.

When we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.

I should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.

Solid fried chicken. Reminds me of my dad's best friend's pizza shop in East Los Angels (R.I.P. Rocky's Pizza), as in lightly floured and then fried so that the crispness is all in the skin, no breading.

The cornbread was delicious, not too dry, with a serving of unnecessary whipped butter that I used anyway. Red beans were terrible. Simply too thick with the consistency of refried beans, and no flavor; I had to add so much freaking hot sauce and it just got absorbed. The collards were alright; tender but still somewhat bitter. 

Contrary to other reviews, I thought the service was fine, although just a little slow. The server came out to tell us exactly how much longer the chicken would be (which showed to me that they prepared it right when we ordered).

Our first impression was ""Wow, this is a very nice restaurant."" The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The servers are professional and very attentive. I treated myself an order of single Tuscan Grilled Porkchop with Roasted Garden Vegetables while my friend went straight for the Shrimp Mediterranean. My porkchop was incredibly moist and tender. There was a thin layer of crunchy fat wrapping about the piece of meat, which actually gave it more flavor and texture. The portion was reasonable so that I did not feel like I was stuffing myself but actually celebrated the food. We, however, did not have the chance to try out their dessert collection.

It is so well designed, there is hardly a bad seat in the house. Even the ones in the pavilion take my breath away. And I love, love, love how the city is framed in the outfield. 

The stadium is located in South Philly, wayyyy down there, away from downtown. It is nice because people can tailgate, which is like a great anthropological discovery for someone from a city whose stadium is right downtown. You can come early? And cook burgers? And drink beer? And you don't have do it at a bar? Fascinating! 

I was pleasantly surprised to discover the games feel shorter when you watch them at the stadium. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the fans are kept entertained, even in the lull between innings. Plus the Phanatic has an effing hot dog bazooka! Come the hell on! But seriously, even if you don't know a thing about baseball, you will not be bored.

The tickets are relatively cheap for a professional sporting event, although they have become more difficult to obtain since the Phillies won the world series. Prior to this season, I used to be able to get decent seats the same week of the game without using a reseller. This is just what happens when your team kicks some serious ass, I suppose.

Thank god they have decent beer here. Seriously. Brewerytown carries Victory on tap and Dogfish Head in bottles. Since Prima Pils is my favorite pilsner, that makes me first a happy lady... then a drunk lady, despite the $7 price tag.

In addition to real beer, there is real food! There are even vegetarian options other than fries and pretzels. At my last game, I tried a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's. It was bready, but certainly nowhere near the worst I've ever had.

Tucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.

We wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice. 

Nicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.

My husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.

Now, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.

My dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make. 

As I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant. 

If you go, and you should, bring a nice bottle of wine, order the langostines and the tiramisu. Enjoy!",2015-10-23 20:00:27

The fried pickles were decent and the tacos were excellent! Good flavor and great texture. I'll definitely be having those again! Don't bother deciding on your sides until you get up to the counter and can see the board because they do not have everything on the menu every day. The mac and cheese was so good! It wasn't what I expected from a BBQ place! The ""baked beans"" we're also good but they are really mixed beans and not at all like the BBQ baked beans you get at other places. Still good, just not baked. 
They also had Abita Strawberry and the Blackforest Kolsch. Excellent bar selection!!
I'm docking them a star because of the system of ordering at the counter and then taking the plastic number to a table. This system works in theory, and in practice at other places, but you HAVE to keep people from ""saving tables"" when they have yet to order. I get it if you have a group of 10 but for normal sized tables, it throws the whole system off! The line was long last night but the food comes out fast so tables turn over quickly. By the time we ordered there were no open tables. There were around 8 tables taken up by people who were still 20 minutes from ordering. That throws the whole system off! Let people who have already ordered eat. Another table will open up for you by the time you order!
This can easily be solved by posting a sign and asking the servers to enforce it. 
Luckily there were two spots open at the bar.

Scallion Pancakes: 4.5/5 - Delicious.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and had a soft, chewy texture on the inside.  Paired well with the dipping sauce.

First - It's a bar that happens to serve food.  This place is a little dirty but that's part of the atmosphere as noted in another review.  Not roach dirty of course.  So if you're looking for a decent sized bar and bar food then this place is for you.  If you want a decent sit-down meal however...

Our waitress was pretty cute but a little neglectful and forgot my fries and water.  Meh, it's a bar.  When I mentioned it she at least offered to get the fries.

Sue K. noted in her review ""Had some high expectations for this place with the reviews I read and the opinions I heard and I ended up highly disappointed. We ordered baby back ribs and there was a good portion but the ribs were dry as anything.""  I would agree.  I had the babybacks and they were pretty dry.  My partner wasn't thrilled with her sampler platter either so she asked to speak to someone about it.  The manager came over and explained that they cook their ribs to 'have some tug' - meaning that they aren't 'over cooked' as he said and fall off the bone.  So make sure you have some good teeth.  Personally I prefer 'fall off the bone' ribs.  I would also note that there wasn't much taste either.  I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce - which was on the side.

The owner's girlfriend (Jennifer) came over and wanted to speak with us about our experience.  For this I was really surprised and really appreciated her concern.  The owners at least don't run the place like a bar which is a good thing in my book.  She refunded the full meal and requested we come back so they could make it up to us.  I probably won't go back but I do appreciate the offer.  Looks like it would be a nice local bar though.  The owners are pretty cool and I wish them luck!",2011-08-26 00:21:32

The drink station was pushed back into a corner and the food prep area seemed bigger than it needed to be. The restaurant appeared to be very clean and the staff was friendly. We ordered two grinder combos. I had the spicy chicken and Dan had the chicken cordon bleu. Both combos came with a medium drink and a bag of chips. I think our total was around $16. After we ordered, we were told to have a seat and our food would be brought out to us. We grabbed our drinks and some chips and waited somewhere between 8-10 minutes before we received our grinders. This annoyed me a bit, but it was probably because I was so hungry. Well my annoyance quickly disappeared when I took the first bite.

The falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun, rather than traditional pita, which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce. (There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)

The drop in rating comes from the ""Express Lunch"" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people, most of whom ordered the Express Lunch, assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.

I still like the space, as it's quieter than many restaurants, so you can hear one another more easily, but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals. A tiny peeve: the ""giant cookie"" was regular-sized (small?) and fine, for oatmeal raisin.",2017-04-19 16:27:28

Village Whiskey's biggest weakness is actually its high price. Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main. In case you don't frequent Boston as much, Craigie's is a 'real' gourmet burger where French fries and a small salad are included in the price. At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.

I like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.

All in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point. If you are in the area, this is probably the highest quality burger + fries you can get - but it comes at a steep price.",2012-06-26 18:57:00

Tria has a great happy hour (5-7) which offers different lists of wine, beer, and cheese at discounted prices. My friends and I always ordered food from there menu and we loved EVERYTHING! I especially love the asparagus salad with white beans, beets with feta cheese, and their lavender pistachio honey drizzled bruschetta.  Their lemon square dessert is amazing as well!   Their menu does change seasonally throughout the year, which I think is nice.  Their variety of wine, beer, and food offers guests a chance to try new items every visit.

Fried chicken was delicious.  Perfectly fried, not too heavy.  Their was a nice kick on the chicken along with some jalapeño and a nice slaw to go with it.  Fried oyster was good, too. Nicely battered (cornmeal crusted?) and fried.  Not at all greasy.  You can still taste the oyster. The pork belly was decent.  Just as you'd expect from fatty pork belly with pickled onions.  As you can see, I went from the favourite to least favourite (even though the least favourite is still pretty good).  The sliders are pretty small, so expect yourself to order multiple.  No shame.  And at around 3.50-5$, why not?

What looks like a small corner store in Bywater opens up to a large courtyard in back with tables and torches strewn about seemingly haphazardly, like a friend might put together for a party on a Saturday night. 

A stage in back houses an assortment of bands, and from my singular experience I will say the quality of music is exceptional. We saw a great jazz trio followed by a funk trio of organ/guitar/drums that was so good... Shout out to the drummer who had my jaw on the table all night. So tight and sublime. 

To get to the courtyard you pass through the corner store full of wine, find a bottle that suits you, maybe some cheese or charcuterie, then head out back to find a table and park for a bit.

The food was better than either of our meals the previous two nights, and at half the price.

My son - Daves Smoked - Cold smoked patty, fontina cheese caramelized onions

the BF - Ozark - mushrooms, black peppered goat cheese caramelized onions

My son's friend - The Basic - basic burger - +$1 for cheese

All of the burgers were EXCELLENT.  I can only speak for myself, so first of all, all of our food came out HOT, the buns are made in-house and were delicious.  super tasty, nicely toasted and crispy yet soft - i wanted to take some home with me.

I did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries (separate purchase) and it was pretty good, but not necessary.  Burgers were a pretty good size - they were smaller than the bun, but still a good size.  Worth the price?  Sure, this was a quality burger!  My only gripe, however is that the price did not include fries (see below).

No one left a morsel on their plates.  My son's friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange...no one should eat that fast...

Sides:  We ordered two large french fries ($4 each) to share between four people and it was exactly enough.  You have a choice of ""sauces.""   I was not impressed at all - they were just fries, and honestly with burgers starting at about $8 these fries should come with the burgers.  I need to have french fries with my burger, so I will pay every time, but suggest that they re-think this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries.  These are NOT worth the extra $2-$4.

We also had the Cheese Curds - ok not what I was expecting but it was good.  Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples - the bread/crackers however were a nightmare almost funny - they crumbled because they were so thin!  Almost like lace.  They really should be a little thicker.  Again, it was good, but c'mon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the bread/cracker.  

The boys had ice cream, but I won't comment because I did not taste it.  I was too full from the burger.  Hope to on the next trip.  

Overall, we had a great time.  Service was stellar, the place itself is very cute, but I can see how it may be a little awkward if it's packed, especially sitting at the communal table.   Next time we are in St. Louis we will definitely be making a return trip to Bailey's Range!",2011-10-27 13:53:33

The food was incredible...the hummus was fantastic...the falafel fantastic...the greens were easily separated (and tossed..)..the chicken was tender and amazingly tasty...and the rice-lentil mix (no idea what it really is) was terrific...there was also a giant piece of bread...whole bunch of food for $10...

I'd never dined at Timpano before, and was excited to sit down to lunch. I enjoyed the BLT salad. It was like a BLT and a caprese salad got together and made a very delicious baby. I don't know which part was my favorite: the house made mozzarella, the MAPLE CAJUN BACON slices, the fresh tomatoes, the arugula...it was a glorious combination. I officially want to make a return visit and try more of their menu because the food was delish. However, my one hesitation was the service on that day. Our waiter was very very nice, but we were one of maybe 4-5 tables eating lunch at that time (it was dead in there) and I think we were there for a little under 2 hours from start to finish. I'm all for a leisurely lunch, but seeing as I only ordered a salad and my buddy ordered soup/sandwich, I didn't see why everything took so darn long!

I arrived with my fiancé and the place was full so we were asked to wait by the entrance. No problem. A small table opened up after about 10 min, and instead of taking us to the table, the waitress led us to the bar. I usually don't like sitting at the bar because I'm short, and this bar was exceptionally tall. When sitting, the countertop came above my chest and I wasn't able to rest my arms comfortably. Who wants to eat like that? We requested to be seated at the table that was just cleared, and she informed us that she wanted to give that table to the family behind us with a child. Okay, fine, I understand that children can't sit at the bar, so we agreed to let them have the table. We let the waitress at the bar know that we wanted to move to the next available table and she said sure, no issue. Another waitress comes by to take our order, we explain our situation, and she comments that if we want to wait for a table, we shouldn't be sitting at the bar, like it's our fault for being at the bar in the first place. She did acknowledge at least that there were plenty of open bar seats at the time, so it was ok for us to sit there ""for now"". After another 5 minutes, the first waitress comes over and asks us again ""Are you sure you don't want to sit at the bar? If you move to the table you will have to wait longer for the food to come out."" At this point, I'm frustrated but I've already invested some time. We tell her (again) that we do not want to sit at the bar, but if waiting for the food is an issue, then can we order now please? They take our order, and after another 10 minutes, we see another open up. Not unreasonably, we thought that would be our table... Until we see the same waitress gesturing to another party waiting at the entrance, letting them know that will be their table. She comes over and tells us that she had already promised that table to them, and asks us again if we're sure we don't want to sit at the bar. At this point, we were so fed up that we just walked out.

I thought that we had been plenty understanding and even let that family go ahead of us, but they were just completely taking advantage of our patience and niceness. If this is how you treat your customers, I don't care how good your food tastes. I'd give this place 0 stars if I could.",2016-05-08 16:28:31

The Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

We started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!

So I was on my way through Nashville while on a trip to Texas from Maine with my girlfriend and decided to stay in Nashville for the night. We stopped by this restaurant and started off with some drinks which were both fantastic beers that were recommended by our waitress. We then ordered our burgers, I ordered the chili-chili bang bang and the Benton's bacon mac and cheese and my girlfriend got the buy the farm and truffle tots. Now here's where things got interesting and the reason why this place gets a 5 instead of 4 from me...... I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe, it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture, they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do, for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service.

Federal Donuts opened up in my neighborhood 5-6 years ago and I never stopped in to try it out. After hear one raving review after another, I said enough is enough and took a walk over...and I was not disappointed (except for one minor factor).

Upon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient. I told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while I surveyed the entire menu. Eventually I ended up ordering for my dad and I two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar ""fresh and hot"" donuts, and a cold brew coffee for myself. This is where the one bad part of my experience comes in: the price. These five items came to $21.60, which I believe is quite expensive.

The cold brew coffee is soooo good. I feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right, but Federal Donuts sure did! It had a very robust coffee flavor.

The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious; the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside, the seasoning was nice and balanced, the touch of sauce was just right, and the potato bun was very fresh.

The cinnamon sugar donut...just, wow. These people don't lie when they say it's ""hot and fresh."" It was warm, soft, moist, and loaded with cinnamon sugar. I could easily eat 3-4 of those things in one sitting. At $1.50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality.

Their selection is truly outstanding. You have your choice of patties, cheeses, toppings and condiments to build whatever burger your heart desires. I believe there are some suggestions as well if you're not feeling particularly creative that day. 

The last time we were there, my boyfriend got the Kobe beef burger, thick cut applewood smoked bacon, a fried egg and Vermont cheddar cheese. He was knocked to the floor, and has been telling everyone about it ever since. I got a simple beef patty with cheese and BBQ sauce. Maybe I need to be a bit more adventurous next time! Nonetheless, I still loved my burger.

Another great thing about 500 Degrees is the option to get your fries with truffle oil. It's just a little extra flavor added to already spectacular crispy French fries. 

I've always had stellar service here. I loved joking around with the woman who served us last time about coming through hell and high water for an as yet undetermined burger since we had come in out of a torrential downpour and it took me 10 minutes to decide what I wanted off of the menu. I blame it on the rain brain.

My only gripe about 500 Degrees is that it can get a little pricey. For burgers, fries and drinks for 2, we paid about $28. That included one Kobe beef patty, but even without it, you're going to pay a sit-down price for what is really a take-out burger.

1xuiOkd00twlHQBHJ4ODOA,RkTfZGAksML93OYzvW4TMQ,g4KzJc8y7BhW66ieNIwJEA,4,0,1,0,"The Spaghetti Factory is the type of restaurant where you'd see a young couple dining in a romantic comedy.  He'd say something foolish, she'd dump a plate of fettucini alfredo over his head and storm out of the caboose in which they dined, leaving him there in his sad little bow tie.

I didn't even realize that there are dozens of Spaghetti Factories throughout the United States until I lived in LA for a while.  Before that, I just assumed it was a quaint little locally-owned Italian restaurant in the heart of downtown Nashville.  It certainly seems too novel to be a chain, but that's just part of its charm.  The Spaghetti Factory is the perfect place to dine if you're on a date or celebrating a special occasion.  It's classier than most places but not over the top, and they serve all the traditional Italian items you'd expect (every pasta imaginable).

Perhaps the most unique aspect of the Spaghetti Factory (and what made me like it when I was a youngster) is its decor.  They have an old train car in which you can dine, dozens of chandeliers and ornate furniture all over the place.  It's like dining in a Victorian lady's parlor...or something.

The food itself is quite good as well (almost as neat as the atmosphere).  Plus, they have spumoni!  I love that crazy Italian ice cream.  The servers tend to be pretty quick and helpful.  The only problem with Spaghetti Factory is that it is Ground Zero for tourists.  It's as if every joker in a fanny pack seeing the sites on Broad and Second Avenue assumes he is the first guy to discover this neat little Italian spot.  If you can stomach those guys, this is probably your best bet for some good food in the area.",2008-05-05 17:29:17

The ""chef's specials"" rolls are creative and delivered with artistic flair. 

There was a little chaos as the orders were delivered since basically everything arrived at once (even the things called appetizers) and there were no extra plates offered so you had to kind of just eat over your little soy sauce tray. 

The only rub is that we wanted to order bento boxes for our kids and substitute the Shrimp Tempura for the Shrimp Teryaki and the waiter returned to say that this was not possible. Ok, fine.

We celebrated my birthday at HWK last night.  Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.

We were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!

Since it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.

I couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, ""You have to try this NOW!""  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.

The heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.

Justin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.

I had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.

I was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)

I enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.  I absolutely cannot wait to head back for more fabulous food and support this new restaurant!",2011-08-25 18:36:29

I just finished eating at Ru San's with 3 other people.  One of the people in my party didn't even receive their food until we were sitting at the hostess stand waiting TO LEAVE!! Granted the waitress continually reminded us that it was only her 3rd shift, but every mistake was inexcusable.  We walked into the restaurant at 8:30 pm, during the time we were there our order was messed up several times, random food was brought to us many times and we were constantly asked if we had ordered it or not. We had to remind our waitress several times what our order was, additionally when we stopped her to remind her that we had been waiting 30+ minutes for certain items she argued with us by saying that she had already brought it.  If she had actually brought it then it would have probably been in the pile of dishes that littered our table, which another waitress came by to clear AT THE END OF THE MEAL.  Of course, the one dish missing from the dirty junk on our table was the plate that should have been the trash for the shells of TWO orders of edamame we had.  Even though we waited one hour and a half for ONE sushi roll all we got was a simple ""sorry."" Never once did we ever see a manager even to ask if we needed anything or to apologize for the completely ridiculous amount of time we spent at our table. Having been in the restaurant industry since I was 16, I did feel bad that our waitress' colleagues simply let her drown. Unacceptable.  When we left it was 10:20.  The cherry on top, one of our guests had to smash a bug crawling up the wall  of our booth.  DO NOT EAT AT RU SAN'S.",2016-01-30 04:50:32
JBZNH_olPRcLXeFJnDUXHA,WpMZ9RfEa7XIVgeMUlMMuQ,F0AAzMdhv2RyjwHVned5bQ,2,3,2,1,"Let's start off with the positives, great piano bar great selection of wines and lot's of outside seating. Very friendly staff and bartenders are very attentive to the guests at their rail.
Moving on...Parking in the area is a challenge small streets don't help either. I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing. We would have enjoyed sitting outside the weather was not too bad but with properly placed fire pits you could take advantage of all your patio seating.
On to the menu, limited but great because of the size of the establishment and very well priced. The selections were good and diverse which is key to satisfying a variety of palettes but...if you offer small a menu everything that comes out should be perfectly cooked and should taste as good as it looks. I had the pork chop unfortunately it was cooked to a med rare. I do like my pork medium but rare is wrong. My wife had the salmon which looked slightly overcooked but she was fine with it. My friend had the bone in rib eye which was cooked well but as far as taste you can tell it was choice grade and lacked a beefy flavor many look for when ordering that cut. His wife had the tilapia and she did not eat it at all! The breading was soggy and tasteless and was non-visually appealing. Too many bland colors on the menu plate presentation is everything! If it looks good it taste good! 
Also we noticed the menu doesn't offer a description of your sides which this technique is usually used in ala carte menus. I am sure your mashed potatoes are a staple to your menu, but it's important for your chef to check potatoes often through the night because they will brown and become gummy if not maintained right as mine were no good. All of us who received the side of vegi's we received cold and very wilted and over cooked. 
The last item is we never saw a managers presence we had a food issue and no one came to our table to follow up with us. There was also a table that had children running and screaming which causes safety issues for your staff and the children. If the food runner's were taking food and one of the kids tripped or ran into the runner and hot food were to fall on them or one of the guests it would have been serious.",2012-10-08 21:18:25

Several hours after I left, I realized that I had left my phone on the table. I drove back and asked the security guard who was standing outside Brew Brothers if they had found a phone, ""I haven't heard about any phone, I would check down stairs with security."" 

The security office also denied having found a phone. I went home and used ""find my iPhone"". It was still in the casino. I put it on ""lost mode"" - setting my best friend's number as the call back. 

 My friend, Alex, went back the next morning to try and find it. (I was at work, but kept a close eye for any changes on the map via laptop). 

He went up to the brew brothers, and spoke to the manager (bald with a beard).

 ""I was the manager that was on last night, and I assure you there was no phone found last night."" My friend then walked down to security, they hadn't found it.

Meanwhile I was incessantly using the ""play sound"" function via my laptop. At some point Alex was called. Someone said ""hello""... then hung up. 

Alex went back to brew brothers and was like ""I know it's in there."" 

""Ummmm... alright let me check"". He came out with it in hand, and was acting sketchy. ""It was making noise and scaring the employees so we turned it off.""",2017-01-02 07:28:50

Second - While I realize that there are only so many cooks for so many people (cause the place was pretty crowded), it did take like 45 minutes for our burgers to be ready; and, while I understand that these are gourmet burgers with all sorts of special  ingredients... bottom line is I think that the amount of time it takes meat to cook is sort of universal, and burgers should be a little quicker than that.",2013-08-04 13:28:39

Pros: Birra Morretti on tap, sexy menu, chic decor, good service, octopus appetizer, squid ink pasta

Cons: Carpaccio is one of my favorite foods and this was not very good at all (no crostini, horseradish or arugula for one thing...and I don't know where the ""Italian kimchi"" was but of that is a play on words regarding the roasted capers then I'm not sure I follow their line of thinking -- kimchi is fermented cabbage after all), sticks on sticks on sticks of butter is used in preparation of the Carbonara which totally drowned out the taste of the guanciale and I didn't see the value at all in adding corn to the dish, Brussels sprouts are just okay but what's worse is that you smell like them for 2 days (I didn't even eat them the second time around and I still smell them today!), mushroom/fontina/truffle pizza and the Quattro formaggi/pancetta were too rich for my blood.

We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.

We also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).

THE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said ""here you go"" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.",2014-02-24 03:58:18

The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.

We came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. 

We ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.

We caught a band called Washboard Rodeo, and they played some fun bluegrassy-type western swing. We'd made a 7:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately. It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music.

First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. 

However, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. 

Besides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. 

The slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.

Back to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off. Although the noodle bar is pricey the tasty and satisfying dishes makes it worth the investment",2016-04-11 20:36:29

I was thinking about veal since I knew that Italians really do make it best.  My husband and I stopped in to make a reservation for later that night and the host was very friendly and said ""We don't have anything open until 8:30pm"" but that was no problem for us and we just strolled around the surrounding area and stopped in a few shops while we were waiting.  At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender, the mushrooms were delicious, and the sauce,  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.

If you're visiting Philadelphia and are looking to explore some of the sites in the old city this is definitely the place to go. We stayed over the July 4th weekend and were right in the middle of all the festivities. The room is beautiful and colorful and fun and well furnished. The front desk staff and  front door personnel are always very helpful. The room is plenty spacious with great views, at least from our room. Make sure to sign up for the reward program as you'll have free wifi and a ten dollar credit for either the mini bar or the bar downstairs. The hotel is also pet friendly which is a great option for those traveling with pets. A few issues that did arise during our stay. The bed is very firm, so be aware of that if you have issues with that type of bed. Also, parking is by valet only and costs $50 which is quite steep. If you don't mind the walk, there is a parking garage, Bourse, about a block and a half away which only charges $28. There are also no garbage bags in the room which can be quite annoying when you're traveling with pets. There was also a dog on my floor which kept barking for about five hours straight numerous nights in a row. The hotel staff did not seem to be able to handle this situation, except to call my room asking me to control and handle my dogs which were silent. Finally, there was a fire alarm that went off which forced us to evacuate from the tenth floor with the dogs which wasn't much fun using the stairs.

Vibrant color, flowers, natural lights fun stair cases, decorative window panes... Really fun environment. 

Service was a little slow, but considering they were packed to the brim because of our conference I let it slide. Waitress and hostess were really friendly. 

This place has delicious and fresh burgers that come in such unique flavor combinations. I came back a second time just to try another one. First one I had was the Hog-Thai'ed which was a peanut glazed burger served with Thai rice noodles. SOOOOOO GOOOD. The one I had the next day was the American. (If you're worried about your cardiovascular health, please don't eat this one.) it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried Mac-n-cheese. Let's just say it changed me. Fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces. Loved the sriracha mayo. A must try.

He says: I definitely like MexiCali.  My favorite burritos from them are the ones that have sweet potatoes or plantains.  While not your typical burritos, they actually mix quite well with meats like chicken.  One notable thing about MexiCali burritos is that they tend to be a bit wet.

There were 3 (maybe 4?) tables, florescent lighting, and we were given a roll of paper towels for napkins.  But the guy who owns it (also our server) was endearing because he was very enthusiastic about the food he and his wife make.

We only noticed Indian dishes on the menu, so we asked about the difference between Indian and Pakistani food and he told us there is no difference since they used to be the same country.  Here's what we ordered and my opinion of each:

- Keema (Lamb) Samosas.  I'd only had vegetable samosas before, so I was expecting these to contain a mix of veggies and meat,  but they were all lamb (no complaints here).

- Lamb Nihari.  This was delicious and my favorite thing we ordered.  The sauce was rich and creamy and had pieces of ginger in it.  I would absolutely order this again... Omnomnom.

- Goat Pishwari - I'd never had goat before, but it was great - I highly recommend it.  The meat was tender and the sauce was good, but not quite as great as the Nihari.  I would definitely order goat again, but I'd probably switch it up and try a different goat dish.

- Chappati.  This was a type of flatbread that I'd never had before - I don't remember it having a distinct flavor, but the texture was good and it was great for mopping up sauce.

- Garlic Naan.  This was the only disappointing thing on the menu - it was chewy and hard.  We abandoned it in favor of the chappati.  Maybe it was just a bad day... I'd give it another chance (it was only $1.50).

Our bill was $37 without tip for all that and a cup of Chai.  Not bad.  I knocked off a star since it's not good for eating in (and has a cheesy name), but I would absolutely get takeout from here again.",2013-01-03 03:29:46
gVMGuWs0LbJq6drWqf5e7A,pvKSZ-aVL7IgPlKifdu--w,N5ekxQd7wGHWJJK-p9qqXw,2,0,0,0,"TL;DR -- Overpriced ""nickel and diming"" with mediocre cuisine and mediocre service.

Our party of six was attracted to Moto by their ads for ""Moto Mondays"", which is a tasting menu with a  flight of wine for $25.  

Upon being escorted to our table, they stepped on one of my pet peeves which is immediately trying to up-sell us on Pellegrino vs ""tap water"".  We were fine with tap water, which was served European style-- lukewarm with no ice.  Since it was 83 degrees outside with 70% humidity, we found this unsatisfactory and had to request ice.

When we asked about the tasting menu, we were told that the serving sizes were very small and we should get something else.  I find it obnoxious that a restaurant advertises a special and then when you get there they try to convince you not to order it!  ""It will never satisfy you!""  Then why are you selling it!?  If the answer is ""bait and switch"", then it's  a fake deal.  It tells me you don't want repeat business.

Everyone else in my party ordered something else, but I stuck with the tasting menu.  After all, that's why I showed up.  True to the waitress's warning, the three dishes which comprised the tasting menu failed to satisfy.  There was a tiny crudo (raw whitefish with rock salt) paired with a heavy red, a tiny mushroom pizza paired with a sparkling rose, and a thick piece of toast with a thin layer of prosciutto paired with a riesling.  In that order. 

The flight of wine was lower quality, didn't pair well with the  food, and the servings were miserly splashes.

The crudo was so over-salted that I had a hard time eating it and it made no sense with the red.  I'd just started on the mushroom pizza when the waitress dropped by to ask if everything ""tasted wonderful"".  I said that the mushroom pizza was nice, but that the fish was too salty.  She replied, ""here, we love our food salty"".  I don't think that insulting your guest's palate is a great customer service technique.  

To sum up, the tasting menu, far from being a chef's calling card, an opportunity to experience something fun and creative, was a half baked and poorly executed marketing exercise-- and a terrible value to boot.    No one else in my party was particularly impressed with their dishes either.  The phrase ""not bad but overpriced"" came up a lot.  I wound up embarrassed that I'd suggested the place.

As a final insult, Moto's enforces mandatory 20% tipping.

J5CDzT6SBIKraGHJ8bJraQ,O8CX9zJnY5yXobZzsOclVg,i7syG2Gyr_qVPR1GwehzuA,2,0,0,0,"They have dulled like their steak knives. Used to be a treat to go here and now it is just really expensive. Their target audience is clearly only people over the age of 60. There wasn't anything special about the appetizers or desserts, and unfortunately the cliche crab cake and chocolate lava cake were the only highlights. 

The old fashioned cocktail was a healthy pour, but the most lack luster of Indianapolis, and a featured drink on their menu too. I think the bitters were forgotten and the orange zest was just a small piece of torn off skin. The glass had a single large ice cube, but they brought out the bourbon in a decanter filled with small ice cubes. It was barely anything more than very very watered down bourbon by the time it was poured. Guess they only know how to serve wine. 

For entrees, I ordered the special, a dry aged New York strip, but it was totally overpowered by a thick pepper crust, which completely ruined the point of the dry aged flavors, for $60. To add insult, the steak knife was duller than  the butter knife, and I never had to work a knife that hard in a white linen.   The lobster tail for $26 was dried out and mediocre. The highlight of my wife's $50 salmon was the hollandaise sauce and side crab, the salmon itself was thin and uninteresting. 

We opted for the chocolate lava cake for dessert, which was the only thing worthwhile. The dessert menu was boring steak house safe bets: lava cake, cheese cake, berries and cream, creme brulee. 

Service was very good at least, although slow for being a quarter full on a Thursday night. 

Overall, a rather disappointing showing and it seems they have gone the way of Ruth Chris and outlived their Glory days. The dry aged steak dish was completely mis-designed and the menu is just as stereotypical unimaginative steak house as it gets. In hindsight, we probably could have had a far better, or at least similar experience, across the street for a hundred bucks less, not to mention whats available in half of downtown Indianapolis. For $250 for two, at least we have fond memories.",2018-02-23 22:43:14

It was very informative and interesting, and I appreciated his excitement and knowledge about the different flavors and combinations.

We eventually decided on the crazy chaat, a blend of a lot of chaats.  I say ""we"" decided because he took my feedback - and perhaps my mood - into account.

Seemed like an appropriate venue for a wedding reception.   Menu had way to many choices. Two pages for just starters. Hard to make up your mind. ""Less is more"".  Service was okay. I ordered a seafood salad as my entree, my friend ahi tuna (seared) and my other friend a chicken sandwich.  We also ordered 3 starters for the table. Spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name), tuna ceviche and edamame.  Its is really hard to mess up edamame, so that was okay. We did not finish the ceviche, it had no taste at all. The shrimp starter was the high light of the meal. Very good!  My seafood salad was really sad.  I felt like a rabbit eating dry vegetables. I told my server that I wanted to change my dressing to just plain lemon and olive oil. The salad came out with no dressing at all. My friends ahi tuna was pretty bad. Just did not taste fresh and the sauce for dipping was bland. My other friend enjoyed his chicken sandwich. I have two things to say. 1-they seemed to have put more attention into the way the food looked on the plate then the flavor of the food.  The plating was above average.  2- if you go, try to stick to basic dishes that are hard to mess up,  for example there seared ahi tuna dish was a disaster, but there grilled chicken sandwich was good.  Anything on the menu over $15 stay away from.   I most likely will not return unless I hear that they have consolidated there menu and changed the flavor profile to most of there dishes.

It's usually not worth the effort, and if I don't like a restaurant I simply won't go back. But this place... my goodness. Easily one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. 

Ordered the Veggie Benedict, but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal, it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: ""It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites."" Uh, ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs, but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites, and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass, and she comes back. ""Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites, so if you want them they'll have to scramble them."" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever, I don't care that much so, ""Sure, that's fine.""

It took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy. Empty tables, no wait.

Finally our food comes out, and what do you know it's cold. Not just room temp. Cold. We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because ""they have so many hands."" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour, and to get it out warm. 

On to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy, easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza, but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all, since all it had was spinach, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food, she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold, oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out, and left my mouth, lips, and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz? The stuff in a can? Yeah.

It's a shame it's so small, as it makes it NOT a good choice for one of those Friday nights when you're like ""hey, why don't we...?""  But, I'll forgive it for its smallness and move on to my fav things there.
The first time I ever went there like 5 years ago, I got the El Fino Wrap (it's this wrap with poached pears, gorgonzola cheese, toasted (i think) pecans and maybe some dried cranberries and onion?), and I almost passed away it was so amazing. To this day it's still my favorite thing there, and in my top 5 favorite foods on earth.  They don't have it on the dinner menu though, but you can always order it.  THAT is my ultimate fav.
In terms of soup - they are like soupmakers from the future.  Flavor combos I've never heard of warm ginormous bowls. The thai carrot soup makes me want to live in Thailand and become a carrot farmer.  They drizzle this creme fraiche on top and.... yeah.  You get it.  I also had this really awesome beet soup there... Which reminds me...
Those crazy cooks at Blue Sage are like Masters of the Beet.  In fact, I was not aware of the degree at which I adore the beet until I'd seen it cooked/utilized about 5 different ways there. It's awesome.
Then it's like, okay.... What else could they do to be Awesome McAwesometon?  Oh, they could have world-class desserts (w vegan options too) that make you want to setup a little cot and just live in their dining room.
So, obviously, I love this place.
One more thing - I prefer Blue Sage for lunch.  The options are there, it's cheaper, and they actually have more stuff I like on the lunch menu.
DInner gets a little too grainy for me - literally.  I mean, I like quinoa, but it just doesn't wow me like the lunch stuff does.  Na mean?

Pros.

The ramen is great! The wings everyone is talking about are so delicious. I'm hoping to try everything on the menu. 

It's cute no seriously the only way I can describe this noodle bar is cute its like if a bunch of american teens got together and opened a noodle shop cute. I like that I can also watched the chefs make the food if I am at the bar it makes the experience a bit more interactive, I know I'm reaching but it's honestly like watching the cooking channel and them handing the food to you when its done.  

The drinks are daring and cool looking, okay im not much of a drinker in fact I prefer for my drinks to taste like anything but alcohol but still they are great to look at. 

Cons.

It's a little tight. But in today's economy most new restaurants are and I'm here for that. So leave more good reviews and hopefully in enough time they get a bigger spot.

This is more of an unpopular request but maybe a sake lemonade or sangria for us sweet cocktail lovers or a sweet cider on the beer menu.

It's owned by the same folks who own the amazing South Street Flowers a few blocks down -- so they are experienced at doing business in the South Street corridor. Located a few doors down from Whole Foods, and across from a Starbucks, and Percy Street BBQ, they fill in a retailing gap left by a very lackluster Ritz Camera and just may help draw the crowds up South Street a little further. 

Decor is bright, eye-popping lime green, white and orange-colored, high-style furniture make for an upbeat decor, with super-sized fruit photo light boards, and a wall of sleek stainless yogurt soft serve dispensers. You take a cardboard cup (only a large available at opening) but fill it with however much, or little, of their various enticing flavors as you like. (You pay by the weight.) Just ask, and they are glad to pull out tiny shot cups for you to sample flavors. (Could use tiny wood or plastic spoons, or you need a very long tongue, to get the full taste of the samples. They provide larger, plastic teaspoons with your purchase.) 

On our opening day visit the flavors included intense Mango, Blueberry, and the tangy Original flavor. Also Peanut Butter, Chocolate and Cappuccino were among the more flavorful offerings, plus vanilla, and a half dozen other flavors I can't remember. Between my husband and I, we must have tried at least 8 flavors and loved them all. Chocolate and Blueberry were our favorites, but that may change on the next visit. 

After getting your cup filled with your selections of yogurt (or just one flavor, if you're that single-minded) you move to the toppings bar where no fewer than 20 toppings can be had from small bins, or tubes. There were standard kid-appeal: sprinkles, chopped up hot pink sugar wafers, crumbled chocolate chip cookies, and gummy candies balanced by more adult toppings of dried fruits, crushed nuts, fresh strawberry puree (which I loved over the blueberry, strawberry, Mango mix I enjoyed) and so many more I can't even remember. 

There is both cafe table seating in lacy lime plastic chairs, or higher counter seating along the 9th Street window. Given the owners' other business venture down the street, it is no surprise there are beautiful fresh flowers throughout. 

As I watched each person come through the line and make their own little bit of a mess -- as folks do -- I also saw the staff right behind them straightening and cleaning things up so each customer gets a fresh Berry Sweet experience. 

Main criticisms are few but essential: they must add napkins (if they were available, they were completely hidden and not offered at checkout even), add an easily accessible posting of nutritional information (especially being near Whole Foods, people are allergy and diet conscious), and a water cooler with small cups would be a welcome addition. Add a recycling bin next to the trash bin for plastic spoons, or use wooden spoons. 

Best of luck to this lovely little yogurt oasis. For now, open 'til 11pm. Perfect.",2010-08-22 21:57:34

The price is great for the amount of food; however, the quality of the food was just above average.  The servers continually brought out the wrong orders to our table, and we waited 20 minutes after being seated before our server came over to the table.

The food: 3/5
Due to the size of the menu, your selections are very limited. I wasn't a fan of any of the apps except for the korean pancake. The kimchi and side dishes I thought were pretty fair. The soft tofu there I thought was pretty good especially for $10. But on top of that the level of spiciness you can request is awesome! The protein in the soft tofu I think are lacking and it's very subtle. You'd forget what you had ordered because their would be only one or two pieces.

I went with 6 other people so initially we ordered a few plates to all share and then ordered our own plates. I tried the kale salad with fried goat cheese which was AMAZING! It didn't have too much dressing on it (I hate when my salad is drowning in dressing!) and was nice and crispy. It had dried cherries on which gave it a little sweetness which added a nice touch. 

I also tried the Pure de garbanzos which was also very good. It had the consistency of hummus but was much more flavorful than traditional hummus and instead of pita bread, it came with toasted bread. So yummy. 

The Gambas al Ajillo was merely shrimp in an spicy garlic oil. I was not as impressed with this dish, but the complimentary bread tasted damn good dipped in the spicy garlic oil!

Finally, the Flamenquines de Pollo which was the chicken stuffed with spinach was very good but was a bit hard to share because it was hard to cut the chicken into smaller, even pieces. I think that dish is best for one person.

They do the meze/chef's tasting (no other options).  $35 for meat and $30 for vegetarian options.  Between two of us, we split one of each so we could try everything.  We did not regret it!

The meze is basically a tapas-style meal - where they serve about 5-6 tapas per order.  By the end of the night, we couldn't even keep track of what we had eaten.  Everything was flavorful, the right mixture of rich for certain dishes and light for more vegetarian options.  We tried octopus, lamb, chicken, bison... just the range was very impressive.  And we loved that they served most richer dishes on a bed of salad, or something else complimentary to the tastebuds.

 Sitting behind us was a group of regulars who come every Sunday, which we noticed right away and took it as a good sign.  

Service was great - servers were attentive and sat us right away at a table outside even though we had no reservations and had no idea they had a chef's tasting that night.  They just kept coming out with more and more food, so if you come, be prepared to be stuffed.

SPANISH FRIES

And if you've had them (with melted cheddar of course, not that greezy spray-on cheese) you'll know why they deserve all capitals and a separate paragraph...effin' amazing. jalapeno peppers, cooked onions, melted cheddar, and old bay...this much fried goodness should be one of the seven deadly sins...

They added a downstairs which helps with overflow, but lacks the bright open airiness of upstairs, and kind of feels like being on punishment when all of the cool (and early) people hog up the space by the upstairs bar. But fret not, the food is just as good and the drinks are never weak.

It is unique, somewhere between the Steve's (whole flat slice) and Jim's (chopped to death) presentation.  It works REALLY well, texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny, and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly, the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did, but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes, and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good, but these were pipjng hot, and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz, but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.

Possibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule, where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.  The accents tell you you;re not in Kansas, but the hospitality is sans atty-tude.  It really does transport you to another era,,

So background to how we came up to this place.  Came here with my boyfriend when we were in Philadelphia for a business trip. The place is small and cozy. When we got there, it was 9pm and had been walking around in 20degree weather, so we were down for something warm. Here is where half a star leaves the rating. The hostess did not look like she wanted anyone coming in. She had a little attitude when she told us to stand by the ramen wall. When seats were available, the hostess took her sweet time cleaning up despite people waiting to be seated.  I understand the place is a little cramped but it does not take 10mins to clean a table, especially if the table is literally 3x3. The waiter and waitress were wonderful and after we had ordered I was watching the chef cook.  The other half star for the following: The entire time the chef was cooking, she would pull her phone out and text. That's disgusting! She wasn't wearing gloves also. The chef is picking up up ingredients with her hands that she just used to text and puts them into the bowls they're serving! Now onto the food. My bf and both got the miso ramen with the spicy bean paste as an add on. The broth was good but after adding the spicy bean paste and mixing in the egg, it got creamy and even better.

Only after we got our food and our table (including kids!) began commenting about the portion size did my wife remind me when we were here last I said I was glad my company was paying!!

I realized I'm getting a bit long winded so...
* Skip the 'gluten free' bun and go breadless, it's poor tasting and falls apart.
* the ""pretzels"" are balls of sweet dough that taste like they were previously frozen and defrosted
* the good news and bad news on the Caesar salad croutons were that they (good) seemed house-made (bad) were badly over-toasted.
* I thought the $5 fries we received were the $3 fries based on the quantity and the table consensus was they could have been a bit crispier/fresher.

The manager only took off the $1 gluten free bun upgrade and the ""pretzels."" He was apologetic and blamed it on being understaffed.

The Yelp reviews were pretty positive, so I figured we'd give it a go. Most of the reviewers are correct. This food is FANTASTIC and made with high quality ingredients.

Given that we were going the Sunday before Memorial Day, I called ahead to make sure they had some availability. The hostess told me we'd have a table for 1pm, and we arrived a little early. Another couple also had a table for 2 for 1pm, but due to a clerical error, they could only seat one of us. We gave it to the other couple. This ended up being a pattern for their other patrons who presumably arrived on time and had to wait. This is a pretty bad error considering how much it happened, but given the rest of the experience, I can't deduct a star over something like this. Just be aware that it happens. They were very busy that day, so it took a while for us to get served, but again, not enough of an issue to deduct a star.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the quaint environment and bright colours of the place. It had the same feel as Pop Shop, a grilled cheese place in Collingswood, NJ. It was very cozy, well lit, and country style, what with the counter you can eat at.

We split an order of blue duck fries to start, and they came in a mountainous pile in a large white bowl. Gouda was melted over them with a healthy portion of green onions, as well as some juicy pulled duck meat. Honestly, our meal could have ended there. We were so pleased with them and devoured them in silence- a sure sign of amazing food.

Since both of us came in wanting eggs benedict, we ordered it. Duck benedict with a perfectly poached egg, topped with more green onion and a SRIRACHA HOLLANDAISE. Yes, you read that. Expecting the usual overly hyped sriracha dish, we were proven wrong when the perfectly textured sauce had a nice sweet finish to it, as true to hollandaise. The bread the benedict was placed on tasted like nothing less than homemade bread (could be wrong, but it was fresh and fantastic). The duck on these eggs was probably 3/4in thick- it was extremely juicy and was a very generous, flavourful cut. Nothing in the duck benedict overpowered anything else.

The good:
They have a community table dinner once a month where they have guest chefs come in and create a buffet (different each month).  It costs $20 all you care to eat and all proceeds go to a different organization each month.  Beautiful concept and beautifully executed.

They make their own gluten free bread.

They have the brilliant combo of bourbon, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  Mmmmm......good.

The not so good:
The gluten free bread leaves a lot to be desired.  Very dense, heavy and super crumbly.  I admire the desire to make things in house but there are way better gluten free bread makers in St. Louis that could provide them with buns.

The burger (ABC burger) was dry and way too overcooked for my taste.

We made a reservation and specifically told the receptionist that we will have a baby in a stroller. When arriving right on time for our 6:30 reservation on Friday 07/17/15 the hostess had this mean face. I informed her that we had a reservation and provided her the information. In a not so friendly tone she asked me if everyone was present. We informed her no, but they were on their way. The door to the restaurant is one of those spiral hotel lobby doors. My dad didn't know how to get the stroller inside. The male hostess walked to the door and was informing my father to go around. When I saw they were here, I walked up to the mean women and informed her my party was complete. She watched with an even uglier face on as my father walked in with the stroller. She ignored me as she was watching him and I repeated twice that my party was complete. She finally decided to talk to me and informed me that the stroller cannot go by our table. I then replied that I specifically informed the receptionist about the baby. At that moment the hostess raised her hand to my face to tell me to stop. I was shocked and wanted to hit her hand out of my face. However, being in a nice place I kept it in and just walked away. The male hostess sat us at a table that had booth seating. He pulled the table out for some of us to slide in and he walked away! So the rest of the party pushed the table back. I then was telling my family how shocked I am about our dinner experience starting the way it did. Mr. B's is a more upscale and nice restaurant and I didn't feel the southern hospitality at all! I had better service the night before at ACME! 

Our server Kevin & Renata then greeted us but being so heated I asked for the manager. EJ (Manager) came and I informed him of what happened. He offered to buy us our first round of drinks (which was very nice, but was not necessary). 

Kevin & Renata were amazing! They turned our dinner completely around the recommended amazing dishes and treated us with respect. They both are great assets to Mr. B's restaurant. I dont leave 40% tips often, but when I do it's well deserved!

ouEa51dYUIZLniuv2BrCPg,8NjgVWDhLFNOTy19wJBoig,PY9GRfzr4nTZeINf346QOw,2,2,1,1,"I have mixed feelings about the Peppermill. I have been coming here for many years, since way back before the remodel. While the remodel, new spa, new pool area, new restaurants and new tower are all nice, it seems that sadly, customer service went away with the remodel. During my most recent visit, this last weekend, I had an issue with my room rate. I checked in using the express check in kiosk, and did notice that the rate coming up was incorrect. However, my friend and I had appointments at the spa and did not want to be late. So, I decided I would deal with it after our treatments. Upon returning to our room, I called the front desk and the woman I spoke with was pretty rude. Not customer service-oriented AT ALL. She tried to tell me that I was wrong, and that per their system, the person I spoke with on the phone quoted me at a certain rate for an upgrade. I explained to her that I called in for a FREEE UPGRADE offer I had received, and applied it to an existing reservation. Which to me, means, no additional charge (FREE?). I was never quoted ANY dollar amount when I called to modify my existing reservation. She proceeded to ask what number I called from, advising that she would try to pull the phone conversation. I explained that I called from my office, which has multiple phone lines, but gave her the main phone number. She replied with ""We'll see what we can find and adjust the rate accordingly"". And abruptly HUNG UP. 
       Side note about the spa - they were pretty friendly and seemed more service oriented. My friend had a Mama Mia Maternity Massage wich she said was EXCELLENT. I had a tuscan ritual which was just OK, really not worth the price I paid. I've had better massages for half the price. The atmosphere and whole spa experience was great though. I will most likely return to the spa, but may try a facial or something different next time. 
         Trying not to let the woman at the front desk's indifferent attitude get to me, I ventured down to the casino. Being a passport member, I had received an email offer for free slot play prior to my trip. Unfortunately, I did not remember to bring the email with me. I went to the Passport Services desk and explained this to them, wondering if they would honor the offer anyway. The woman at the desk knew precisley what promotion I was referring to, but responded with a quick, ""You need to print and bring the email in."" It seems that unless you are a high-roller, they are not very acommodating. 
        Defeated, I went back to the room and went to sleep. I wasn't in any mood to spend ANY money in their casino at that point. I was so turned off by the over-all lack of service that I did not want to spend a single cent more than was absolutely necessary in this place. 
       The next morning, upon check-out, I explained the problem with the room rate to the woman at the front desk. She reviewed the system notes and advised (in an unapolagetic manner) that the rate had been adjusted by the Graveyard Supervisor. Although I was pleased that they did honor the rate I was quoted, I am having a hard time getting over the lack of service and poor attitudes of the employees I encountered. I work in customer service and can not imagine treating clients in such a manner. I have another stay booked for April (which I would have cancelled without hesitation if the rate had not been adjusted) and am really hoping for a better experience. The next trip will be the Peppermill's last chance to redeem themselves. I will post a review to update after that stay. I hope I have a much better experience.",2012-03-02 21:00:17

To my surprise, Toyota SB had the lowest price and the salesperson emailing me, Freddy Barajas, was super patient--keeping in touch via email but without any pressure to buy.  Other dealerships were calling a lot, using the typical smarmy lines that give car salespeople a bad reputation.  This was absolutely not the case at SB Toyota.

I mean, really, it's as if i'd been let down because a cuban restaurant didn't live up to my Miami standards. I didn't come to Nashville to eat sushi, but I really craved it while I was in town and my girlfriend who was showing us around said she'd been there a long time ago and remembered that it was a buffet-style place in a great location.

Done deal. We get there, and she was right about the area. The food was quite underwhelming. Nothing tasted very fresh. In fact, everything I got from the sushi buffet was soggy and maybe even slightly warm (not good for uncooked food). They do have a small sake selection of sake of which we enjoyed an unfiltered bottle of.

Let's just get it out of the way, the tacos are pretty legit. I eat at the taco trucks and the down and dirty corner stores and these are pretty good. The restaurant did right by not pricing themselves out of this market. It is a tad pricey, but i think it is worth it--$3.50 per. 3 = $10.50. Mexican places hover around 3 for $8-9, so the price point isn't too far off. 

What separates and warrants the additional pricing is the finished product compared to traditional Mexican spots. Instead of just the meat being center attention, there are Buena Onda has additional garnishes that elevate a typical street food. 

I ordered:
-fried mahi mahi
-carnita
-carne

all were pretty good but the winner by a mile was the mahi mahi. I used the red hot sauce (in the jar, not bottle), so i can't review the green one. The red sauce was really nice, added more flavors to the already flavorful tacos.

Here were the misses...

1. my cousin and i ordered 4 tacos. Cashier rang up 3. 
2. we ordered 2 modelos. Cashier rang up 2 modelos AND 1 CORONA
3. we showed him the ""rewards"" program to get discount. Cashier never gave discount. 

When we paid, i was wondering why it was so high (expecting the discount) and why we got a Corona? Our order was not complex...we did not ask questions. Just put order and paid. I defended the cashier saying ""they just opened, must be oversight"". BUT, my cousin believes he was high while on the job. OH well. 

ALso, i'm not sure how their system is setup because all 3 tacos came out on one tray. What if two people share 3 tacos like i did? I had to ask for another tray, which wasn't a problem, but inconvenient considering we ordered ""separately"" but paid all together.",2015-10-17 21:07:25

When we got there, our table was almost ready so the hostess asked us to wait at the bar. We got a drink while we were waiting and the bartender happily transferred our tab to our table. They had a specialty house drink which my boyfriend and I both tried, it wasn't my taste but he loved it. There was a band playing that night, and our table was close by. The band was wonderful, played excellent jazz!
The food is served tapas style so it comes out as it's ready. We started with the fries, topped with feta cheese which were perfectly crispy and delicious. We got the bulgogi rice bowl which was flavorful but could have had a little more meat and vegetables to go with the rice. We were still hungry so we got an order of the mac & cheese and the bruschetta which were both phenomenal, I recommend getting each. After my house drink I had one of the beers, the fire ant, which was delicious. At the end of our meal the hostess came by to ask us if we minded moving to the sidebar table as they were behind on the reservations. It was a little offputting to be asked to move after spending $80 on a meal, but I understood and we happily moved. I read reviews that the servicehere was lacking and the bartenders were rude, but this was not our experience. The server was attentive, and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful in ordering and was happy to transfer our tab for us.

Their service department is great.  They can almost always get me in quickly and their clean and roomy courtesy shuttle takes me to and from my office, making all of my maintenance visits convenient and painless.

Most recently I have worked with Bri and Gina as my service advisors.  Both of them do a great job explaining what will be involved in an upcoming service and how much it will cost.

I had my car in for service today, including a scheduled recall item.  Gina carefully reviewed the maintenace history from my past several visits when I checked in, and she discovered that I had paid (alot... $400+) to replace a part that had since become a warranty-covered recall replacement.  She informed me of this, and that since this was now a recall item, that I would be able to get a reimbursement for my earlier replacement charges.  She also took time at my checkout to prvide me with all of the backup paperwork that I need to submit for and obtain the reimbursement.  

Gina's excellent service this afternoon is a great example of the overall excellent service that this dealership's service department has consistently provided to me over the past five years.

I always get a follow up call after a service appointment and Toyota asks if I would rate the service as ""excellent"" and in every case I can honestly answer ""YES"".",2013-02-22 05:04:00

Truly.

First bit of fabulousness:  Upon being seated, I ordered coffee.  To which, my server responded, ""Sure...we have a house roast, dark roast, or a vanilla flavored?""

Are you kidding me?  A breakfast place with coffee OPTIONS?  And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).  This was definitely not your usual (awful) diner coffee.  It was dark and delicious.

Fortunately, my dining companions were familiar with the menu and HIGHLY recommended the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  

The Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.

One final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).  And, they've got your savory (An entire list of various Benedicts, skillets, and classic to creative omelets).  I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy.

Plus, I was informed they have an entire gluten free menu.  Not merely the slight modification of items on their regular menu--but an entire menu of creative gluten free options.

While some may be blaise about the tour, I've never been to a brewery tour before, and it was interesting, though I was disappointed because they were not in production.

If you really want to see things in action, you may want to call first just to make sure that it's a production day. The tour guide was really nice, well spoken and while in the lab, we were lucky enough to run into the brew master! He was very nice, and took the time to answer our questions, even from that ""one guy"" who always has to ask repetitive dumb questions. Of course the free beer tasting at the end was great as well.

Large rotating craft beer selection with and even superior bar staff that's friendly, knowledgeable, and locals themselves you'll quickly come to realize why this is my tampa go to bar.  Before moving to Seminole heights I was living in temple Terrace and didn't mind driving here just for a beer because of the atmosphere, the people, and the food.  

-Cool people ranging from hipsters-business professionals: check
-Beer: check (double check since they offer a great craft selection)
-atmosphere with a great outdoor patio where the neighborhood meets: check
-food (which is not your typical low quality bar food) while not a requirement for me has come in handy on the nights I end up spending 3+ hrs here lost in conversation: check

 
Overall it's my favorite bar in tampa.  Alas it's not anything like what I long for, which is a divey bar like Mt Royal Tavern in Baltimore, it certainly has picked up the gauntlet of being my go to everyday bar since I've moved.

I didn't realize how close it was to Lower State street and a little walk to the beach.

To switch things up, I ordered the Dragon Bowl which had pitaya, mangoes, kiwis, and bananas. The texture of the acai was very different. It had a glue-like texture rather than the classic icy-smoothie style. Besides the texture throwing me off, this was great! The sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn't so cold that it gives me a brain freeze! What really surprised me was how big the portion was. If you're not that hungry, I would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl. 

The acai bowls are a little more on the pricier side~ $9 but it is a filling meal.

So I will try not to complain about that since that is out of everyone's control.
This is ridiculously easy to get to.  For that reason I definitely recommend it.  We decided to do this and we did 6 miles in three hours.  Seems slow I know but consider having two children with you as well.
The beginning was pretty flat but for more experienced hikers there will come a part where you definitely get those thigh burning, real challenging parts.  
The beginning there is no shade since it is flat but you start going up the elevation and it is beautiful.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I must say I was hoping to get to the Waterfall which before you do that remember to educate yourself on what time of the year the waterfall actually has water.
I would definitely do it again.  Since I am a beginner hiker I absolutely adored it and would recommend it to others as well.

The menu was created by Marquis and Rich Landau, known for the upscale vegan restaurant, Vedge, and his previous endeavor, Horizon's restaurant. HipCityVeg is a fast food restaurant that serves burgers, wraps, salads, fries, and healthy drinks of many popular non-vegan dishes. I had to try two of these creations!

Let's be honest... These sandwiches didn't last very long! The sandwiches had a lot of flavor and were fantastic! My favorite of the two was the Crispy HipCity Ranch, by a long shot! I liked the Buffalo Bella, but I thought that there would be more of a buffalo flavor. The Crispy HipCity Ranch tasted very much like it's non-vegan counterpart but more fresh and better prepared. I was most impressed by this sandwich! These sandwiches aren't cheap, but are worth the cash if you can spare it!

The restaurant is small. Small enough that I decided to take-out instead of waiting for someone at one of the 5 or so small tables to leave. I decided to just take my order home to eat, but the restaurant is close to Rittenhouse Square, a great park for picnicking or eating from a bench. The atmosphere at HipCityVeg is clean and refreshing. There is water available while you're there that is flavored with fresh fruits. I enjoyed some while I waited for my order to be prepared.

There is a private lounge/restaurant area for diamond club ticket holders, but no pre-game complimentary buffet.  You have to pay for everything that is in there which is also the case for everything you order at your seat.

It was a little tricky to find and I may or may not have ran a stop sign or two as I looked for it.  oopsies! :)  We finally made it inside after my scary driving.  The place is so stinkin' cute.  I love the decorations, the old decor, and the little booths with the radio thing.  

The menu is slightly overwhelming if you're looking for a delicious alcoholic icecream martini because everything looks so gosh darn good!  After debating for what felt like an hour I finally settled on the Thin Mint martini and boy was it good - a tad strong but YUMTASTIC in my mouth!  

Stewart got the Chocolate Covered Almond which also tasted fabulous and the Orange Dreamsicle which I didn't care for.  Then again I don't like orange dreamsicles and this tasted just like one. haha.

Kate got The Great Mississippi Mudslide which was amazing as well and the Love Potion #9.  The love potion one tasted interesting - kinda like a liquid PB&J in your mouth which is an odd sensation but exactly what they were going for.

I'd definitely come back and visit again with friends since it was a cute little place and I'd love to try the others I was debating on.

For entrees, Emily had the grilled snapper tacos and I had the gag grouper dinner. Both meals were delicious! The issues the exist can easily be corrected. It is summer and this is an outdoor venue. You order your food at a hut located behind the bar. However, you have to stand in the HOT sun while ordering! A canopy needs to be installed. There is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay. What we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order. The only menu is a series of high-end cocktails all of which sound delicious. However, the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions. So the delivery is not as great as the written word. Suggestion, cocktail napkins or coasters (they won't blow away) and ice. Alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the Florida summer heat melts the ice also. The plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin. Serve and extra ""real"" napkin with the utensils.

Not only that but i had a 40% off coupon and was going to do 2 separate transactions to use the 40% off my most expensive item and they will automatically do this! AMAZING! I love this store and could definitely get lost in it - there are so many different craft ideas and items you wouldn't think of for gift ideas.

Frankly, I was surprised to even find a Mexican restaurant in Nawlins. We were searching for Nawlins-inspired vegetarian fare (I didn't bother holding my breath for anything vegan) close to my hotel, but didn't have much luck. Seeing a few vegetarian entree options on the menu at Tomasito's we decided to give it a shot. 

Food: 3 stars. To start the table was dressed with chips and salsa. Excellent way to begin a meal. Unfortunately, the salsa was closer to bland than anything else and the chips were a little stale. They tasted like they were made in-house, but they had a sort of limp, day-old quality to them. 

For entrees I ordered the vegetarian fajitas and my sister ordered the vegetarian quesadilla. Both options were solid choices, though the quesadilla was a little overpowering with the variety and strength of the cheeses in the dish. The fajitas arrived flaming, the way they are often depicted in commercials for Chilli's and other similar off-Mexican restaurants. Both dishes came with guacamole, sour creme, and salsa. After a day of family theatrics and no lunch, we were famished, and begging vegetarians in New Orleans cannot be choosy. The food wasn't the best Mexican fare I have ever tasted, but it wasn't bad either, and it was a damn sight better than starving. 

Service: 6 stars, i.e. off the charts. I know ""extreme"" manners are pervasive in the south, but seriously, the service in New Orleans was out of this world. At the very least it knocked Los Angeles out of the park. We were seated right away. Our server was charming and helpful with drink suggestions. He even brought us a sample of their famous margarita when we dithered in choosing our beverage. [In the end we went with the sangria. Tomasito's has a relationship with Tommy's Wine Bar across the street and they serve sangria from Tommy's place. The sangria was perfect: a light kick with lots of fruit on top.] Service was quick, even though we were super hungry and extreme hunger often slows time. Our server was pleasant and available when we wanted him to be and invisible when we were deep in our conversation. He was happy to split the check and we were happy to leave a generous tip.",2011-06-29 03:19:33

* The space is drab and dreary.
* Tables crammed too close together
* Noise level excessively high - impossible to have a relaxed conversation, have to compete with too-loud talking at too-close tables, flatware and plates rattling on the stone tabletops
* Cheesy, cheap paper napkins at a not-cheap restaurant
* Worn, scuffed, cheap diner-type flatware 
* Bread that came with the hummus was stale, tasteless
* Rice and vegetable accompanied all four entrees - rice tasteless and lukewarm, greens mushy, overcooked, oily and unrecognizable
* Entrees rushed out before we had finished our apps
* For our wine, we were given old, small, worn-out flute-shaped glasses - totally inappropriate

A friend I met at the library conference, on the last day, RIGHT before we were about to head to the airport, said, ""Hey, have you guys tried The Range yet?"" 

Hooray for her!  I like burgers and fries as much as the next person, but generally I don't find them a super exciting food.  I would come back here to try more!  Everything is home made (the Sriracha!  The pickles!  The buns!), and reaaaally tasty.  The burger patty was flavorful and tasted like something my mom would make, and I got a fried macaroni and cheese patty on top of my burger.  Yes, a fried mac and cheese patty ON my burger.  

I also love the gigantic list of soda from all around the world (I got black cherry cream soda!), and I wish I had been hungry enough to check out some of the homemade ice cream shakes.  Yummm. 

The atmosphere is cool too, with lots of random quirky decorations, painted milk jugs hanging from the ceiling, windows hung in a gigantic mosaic between the dining room and the kitchen, and more.

I order the shrimp with scrambled eggs ""Chinese"" style. This style is  saucy as the eggs are whipped and cooked in gravy. It needed scallions and a touch of hot chili sauce. They didn't have the chili oil at the table. Maybe you have to request it. I did, however, ask for a little hot mustard on the side. Mixed with a touch of soy, I found the flavor I was looking for.

The jalapeno grits were spectacular and so was the biscuit. My friends seemed to really enjoy their breakfast as well. The fries again, lacked seasoning which seemed odd.

I really appreciate that the rice they served with the curry was a good hefty helping and not dry like other places.  The curries are really rich with flavor...so good!  The price is pretty much about $10-12 per person on average for a standard plate.  It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.

And for those of you who can't handle spicy too well like me, don't forget to request it mild because they won't ask you how you like it and it'll come served with a kick like it's supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).

uqlhve-HegmDcUURZhZPVA,Ytdgo2T5qsrm9_teg1uYmg,skN2XhKXlcjf53uIwzAedw,4,4,0,2,"It's Memorial Day. What better food than a burger?! We're out of town and didn't know what was available (other than the typical fast food joints and Five Guys). We narrowed our search to Burger Up and Cheeseburger Charley's. We settled on Burger Up and boy am I glad.

I'm a fairly picky eater and hamburgers are one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately, all too many places really mess-up a hamburger (Five Guys included). We read some reviews here on yelp and still couldn't be certain we were making the right decision. Someone complained about ""family style seating"" (sitting with strangers) and another mentioned a ""dorked-up"" PB&J.

First, let me say that the decor was quite unique. There were only a few tables where you risk sitting with strangers and I'm certain you could tell the hostess that wouldn't be preferable. Honestly, though, life's short. Chill-out and make the best of it. Are you really that unsociable?! The menu plainly states that it's grilled. Who's ever eaten a grilled PB&J?! If that's not what you're looking for, don't order it.

Finally, for the burgers...

I ordered the classic burger with white cheddar cheese and was completely satisfied. Someone complained that it was dry. You must have gone on an ""off"" night, because our burgers were juicy and quite tasty. The server told us that we could opt for Heinz ketchup, if we didn't like their house ketchup, but who wouldn't like their house ketchup? Good stuff. You also have a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. We didn't get regular fries, but their sweet potato fries were great, too!

Okay, so no restaurant is perfect. Our server, Daniel, was great. Ambiance and food was great. The sweat tea was not good, nor was the lemonade.

There you have it. What they are known for -- burgers -- were definitely worth it. I think someone complained about the cost. We spent $35.00 for two, but where do you not spend that much for two (including a tip).

We'll definitely be back...",2012-05-28 21:52:06

For $16, I was greeted promptly (promptly in my book at a salon is within 15 minutes of my appointment) by my student stylist, Miata. Miata is about the cutest sweetest thing north of Atlanta as far as I am concerned. She was talkative and had a lot of suggestions for what I could do with my hair. 

She also listened to exactly what I wanted -- and delivered. I have fairly course hair (for a white girl) and I don't treat it with much, nor do I blow it dry (on my own it never works). She cut a little less than an inch off (my guesstimation), feathered in fantastic layers, and then blew out my hair. 


I am extremely satisfied -- I normally can't have this type of a cut without spending upwards of $50.

Bacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease.

I did my research on places downtown offering happy hour specials and based on what's advertised I picked Tryst for a gathering of 4. 
We were seated promptly outside. The location and the view are excellent! The outside decor is cozy and elegant. I asked the hostess what the happy hour specials were and she told me they don't have any. I asked our waitress the same question, and she pointed to the section of the menu that lists the offerings. The happy hour specials before 7 pm are half off house wine, some beers, well liquor and appetizer specials. We took advantage of the half off house wine- excellent malbec! The problem was with the appetizers. There weren't any. The menu clearly states -half off appetizer specials.  We were told that they are in the process of changing the menu and currently there are no appetizer specials. My personal belief is that if something is offered, especially in writing, it should be honored and delivered. Oh, well...
The food- it was very good! I'm not a fan of calamari, and I would never order them. After tasting my friend's calamari I did put in my own order. They were that good- tender and juicy! The serving was very much on the small side.

The Hollander may not be Hilton-perfect (there is one of those several blocks away), but it's beyond quaint - it works well.  Most importantly, it's not expensive. And it's a beautifully remodeled historic building with gorgeous hardwood floors, polished to perfection. In addition to the nicely appointed rooms, the stairwells are comfortably furnished, floored with the same gorgeous hardwood.  Which I might not have known if they did not have a slow cozy elevator.  The fun lobby hosts all sorts of entertainment from singing to trivia nights - not only free, but winners might earn some Hollander bucks. The staff, from the desk to the maids, are personable and competent. If you don't want to stroll the few blocks downtown, The Hollander offers a open-air shuttle cart to the downtown area or any nearby destination, such as Tropicana Field (and yes, also free).

On Tuesday nights, the Tap Room there will pour a large frosty mug of any one of their many craft beers for only $3. And the next night you may choose a craft beer and gourmet burger for just $10. Speaking of $10, they have a chef-hosted Sunday brunch for that price, too. Beyond burgers, they have a variety of entrees, including a tasty vegetarian eggplant stack. 

The only negatives I can come up with are, at least while I was there, the techno-crap lobby music they played early in the evening (before the real entertainment started) was not only horrible, some of few lyrics one could hear might've been offensive to families - it was just strange and at odds with the classy BnB feel of the place.  Also, the wifi didn't work well for me, but that might've been my laptop.  Like elevators, if you're looking for luxury showers pouring out waterfalls of perfectly temp-controlled water, this might not be the place for you.  Being an older place, no central air, and that's needed in July, so the in-room units run all the time - not ideal, but they worked well and didn't bother me too much.  One lamp and a cold CFL bulb, the other a warm incandescent which I liked (not sure what to make of that mix;-).  Also, they appear to be dog friendly, as there were a few very well-behaved and nice-looking dogs in the lobby.  Even though I didn't have a dog, I liked that, but perhaps someone else wouldn't.  Oh, and there were folks smoking outside - not much one can do about that here in Florida, but fortunately they have a nice large patio area and was enough enough to find some clean breathing space.

One of several restaurants owned by Chef John Besh In New Orleans.  From appetizer to entrees all the way to the end, dessert. 

For our appetizer we split the Crab Meat Maison, served with fresh herbs, touch of horseradish and country bread croutons. 

My choice of entree was the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp over Roasted Jalapeño Cheese Grits and Andouille/green onion sausage.  I have never been a fan of grits before.  They have always been kind of bland, this one knocked my socks off. 

The wife went with the Fresh Gulf Fish done Amandine Style.  It was lightly battered with buttermilk and flour, then fried and topped with Almonds in a brown butter sauce.  Served with new potatoes, green beans and roasted vegetables. 

Please, try to save room for dessert.  Somehow we did. With two Cappuccinos we ordered Brendan's Bread Pudding. This is to die for! It is topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and is accompanied by a buttered pecan sauce.  Also ordered the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart, made with bittersweet chocolate and topped with Coconut Sorbet.

The staff encourages this relaxed feeling, we never felt pressure to eat and run.  Instead they offered frequent top-offs for our coffee and water.  
Dana, our server, patiently explained the specials (a few times over) cause we couldn't make up our minds.  She made sure that the decaf crowd and non-decaf crowd were served correctly.  Also, she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items.  She was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy.

Everything was top-notch: service, décor and the mouth-wateringly fantastic food. 

The menu was vegetarian friendly, too.  All is farm-fresh and made with great care.  The price was reasonable, especially considering the high quality. 

We each had their blueberry mixed green salad topped with goat cheese crumbles and almonds, dressed with blueberry vinaigrette. It was light and tasty and accompanied by a basket of warm  bread in three varieties.  

We shared the soup of the day, a root vegetable concoction that was super-tasty.  

For an entrée, we shared a starter (plenty of food for us two) of a thai curry with fresh vegies and tempeh with a light coconut milk sauce.  I had to restrain myself to keep from licking the plate. 

It's rare that we have room for dessert, but we made a point of ensuring we did to be able to enjoy the fresh blackberry pie tart.  With a small side of vanilla ice cream, it was a perfect ending to an outstanding meal.  

The tea service at the table was elegant and the coffee robust.   
We could only find one flaw and it was minor. The canned music was a disconnect with the whole experience.  Queen's 'We are the Champions' just didn't fit.

We arrived about 7 pm​ on a Friday night and the place was nearly full with just a few tables left. We were seated immediately at a table for four. The tables are a bit close, with the angle of our table I was practically sitting in the next table, we actually joked with them about it.

Our server was pretty amazing, she got drinks, kept them refilled and took our first course orders, she kept checking back and never made us feel rushed.

My husband and I started off sharing​ a number of appetizers -we started with crab rangoon, gyoza, shrimp shumai and spring rolls. The food came up pretty quickly considering how full the restaurant was. 

The spring​ rolls were light and crisp, the crab rangoon pretty standard, the shrimp shumai was​ moist​ but the flavor was really blah. The gyoza was HORRIBLE, they were hard, dry and not any better than we'd buy in any supermarket​.

The biggest challenge I have is with the food runners, they have several young guys who seem to speak very little English​. They kind of grunt when they come to the table and food is shoved in front of you, whether there is any room or not. 

The portions are relatively small, I completely understand that they will bring you as much as you need. But, the plates they use are HUGE for three small pieces of shumai and the guys running food spill all of​ the sauces out of the wells in the dishes.

For my second round,​ I had the Hot and Sour Soup - it was very good, not to think​ or heavy, nicely​ spiced with lots of tofu and vegetables.

The Seaweed Salad was chilled, a few kinds of seaweed, nice flavor.

The Chicken Tempura was more​ tonkatsu, breaded and fried crisp​, moist and crunchy but not a tempura batter.

I finished up with a Philadelphia and a Spicy Tuna maki roll as well as some sashimi - tuna, salmon​, ​ and escolar​. All three were well chilled, thinly sliced and very fresh. The salmon was super buttery.

My thoughts are all over the place with the little details I love about this place, so let me try to focus on the sandwich and go from there. The menu is pretty tight with how you can get your steak here. There is no whiz (thank god) and the Pizza steak, Steak Hoagie, etc...where not listed (although they do serve hoagies, so maybe if asked nicely you could get one if that's your thing). Next thing to know is that they don't disguise their meat by chopping it up into fine little bits. This is sliced baby, and it is good. The real stand outs for me were the most amazing roll and the fantastic sauteed onions. Both components are easily the best I've yet to have in my travels around the city and made for a delicious gooey mess by the end of the roll.

The place itself has a great vibe. It is tiny and I can imagine fills up during those prime times. Its 5 cozy booths with individual jukeboxes surround a little soda fountain! The place was staffed today with 4 (including the cook) twenty-something girls who rocked the place. They were having fun and totally added to the uniqueness of the place.

We have been here numerous times over the last three decades. Let's just say we used to eat for less than $15 for two and leave it at that. We were downtown for the Nashville Hot Wings Festival which was sort of a disappointment. We purchased the all you can eat wristband - so the fact that we were at the Old Spaghetti Factory should give you a clue as to how well the festival went. Drinks at the bar - 30 minute wait - expected - so no big deal. I have always ordered the potpourri - a selection of four of their mainstay sauces. Getting excited as is see dishes come to tables nearby with the manager's special (two sauce selections) with huge portions of each. I get mine and it's like...wait...what!? Miniscule servings of each of the four sauces. I feel cheated. Don't get me wrong - the flavor was there, but in comparison to neighboring tables as well as others at our table - I got screwed.

If you let them know - you can embarrass a party member that has a birthday, because they ask whoever is in earshot to sing happy birthday to them. Amber was the center of attention in our area. What's funny is that I ran into her on the street a little later and walked up to her and said, ""Amber! How are you? It's been awhile"" She gets this deer in the headlights look trying to remember where she knew me from. ""I'm just messing with you - we were just inside and sang happy birthday to you.""

The inside layout has changed a little since our last visit. What was once the foyer has been transformed into a private dining area for a large group. What was once a waiting area has been made into additional dining space. We sort of miss the Victorian couches and such. The hostess station is now in the area that used to be basically open to the sidewalk. Over the years we have sat in different sections of the restaurant including the trolley car. Think we enjoyed the section facing the river most of all. This trip we were right in the main traffic flow of people coming and going so atmosphere suffered. Also one of the waiters close by must have previously worked for Dick's Last Resort and was probably fired for being too obnoxious - loud - too loud for this place.

As much as I love the food here, my review is only a four star due to the seating policy. I can understand restaurant not taking reservations, but the restaurant also has a policy that they will only seat when all parties have arrived. The parking is extremely limited - so limited the restaurant had to apply for a variance for parking. This means if you have to park on the street and want to drop off an elderly person or your spouse and young children, they will not be seated until you have parked and walked to the restaurant. Once in the pouring rain my husband dropped me at the door with our infant son, and the restaurant staff refused to seat me because my husband wasn't there yet, despite my explanation that he was trying to find a parking spot on the street since their lot was full. There were several open tables and instead of letting me get settled with a few month old baby, they insisted that I wait at the drafty entrance. I left and went elsewhere. I laughed out loud when we showed up for Mother's Day brunch a couple months later and was asked if I had a reservation.

I'd also like to add I was apparently with their best sales representative, Mark, so maybe that's why I am so happy.

We rolled in here last night because I had just checked out an Audi and they...pretty much didn't want to sell me car, so my husband suggested stopping in here.  

They're not pushy here...definitely take the ""if you want to talk, we can, but I'm not up your butt"" - the nonchalance can actually be a little confusing, but I think it's because you're so used to being stalked every time you walk into a dealership.

Told Mark I wanted a C300 4Matic Sport.  We sat down and started going through the packages and I told him ""how about, I just tell you my hard stops and you show me what you have?"" - I hate spending time buying cars, so I kind of cut to the chase.

Mark was fine with that, brought up his selection, but unfortunately there didn't seem to be a black on tan like I wanted, but a white on tan and a black on tan with such outrageous options that I would never want.  White on tan is a nice look so took a model out for a ride - very much like my c280 4Matic...just...sportier I guess!  

We crunch numbers and they seriously don't break your balls here - you will get the best deal they have to offer.  In fact, the deal was so good, I ended up just getting the souped up black on tan that I thought ""no way!"" to because it was just a good deal.  

So, if you want straight talk and an easy purchasing experience, go in - don't email, because the online sales people suck and almost made me never come back - ask for Mark, and you'll be taken care of.",2012-02-01 15:53:17

Unfortunately, my salmon was a little undercooked and my wife remarked that the salmon quality was not as good as before.

The food was also delicious. We all shared the Asturian Blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce, I had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor, my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich (which I have ordered before and is quite good), and our friend had the truffled egg toast, which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items.

The manager was there and she helped the person who was trying to figure out my total (because if you have a brochure and need 100 copies that means both sides need to be printed but it means you pay for 200 copies but only obtain 100 brochures). I was glad the manager was there to help. All of the four young women who were working that day were super sweet and friendly. 

The store was clean and well organized. I got 4 ear bud  be (head phones) cause they were on sale 2 for $10. Plus I got them in four separate colors.

It was Friday before Labor Day weekend. Because of the 3 day weekend there were lots of print orders. It seemed like several were frazzled. So even if they were all frazzled they were able to be professional and super sweet. They wrote up my order and gave me my total and then I paid for it. I sure how that Office Depot reads this and finds out who was working Friday and gives them all KUDOS. So sorry ladies that I forgot your names.",2016-09-06 23:36:44

I loved everything about it. The toast is very soft and sweet. The banana cream inside and the Banana Foster sauce on top are incredible. They are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. I devoured the entire dish quickly. I rank the dish as one of four French Toast dishes that are above all others. I do not even want to rank them 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead, I will rank them 1, 1a, 1b, 1c:

Top 4 French Toasts:

1. Blue Moon Café in Baltimore (1621 Aliceanna St, Baltimore, MD 21231): The Cap'N Crunch French Toast tops my list. Grinding cereal and using it to create a crunchy crust is genius. I also enjoy the fresh fruit on top.

2. Blu Jam Café (7371 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046): The Crunchy French Toast features a cornflake crust. It also has berries on top. I slightly like the Cap'N Crunch French Toast better because I enjoy the Cap'N Crunch crust a little more.

3. Surrey Café and Juice Bar: The Banana Foster's French Toast is on par with both. I give the other two the thinnest of margins because I love the cereal crust. Nevertheless, the banana cream and Banana Foster sauce is an equalizer.

I also ordered a side of home fries. The potatoes had excellent seasoning and a nice crunchy skin. In addition, Surrey is a juice bar. I had a fresh squeezed orange juice. Is a large, 16 ounce juice really worth $6.50? Personally, I would not normally pay for it. However, I wanted to try a fresh juice since I saw great reviews for them. It was very good. Nevertheless, it is a lot more than I would want to pay for juice. I got to Surrey at 8 AM when it opens. The place is great so the seating will fill up quickly. On a Sunday, it was almost full by the time I left at 9 AM.

4. Stanley Restaurant :Surrey's Café and Juice Bar have a slight edge with the toast and Fosters sauce. However, Stanley's additional toppings (bananas, banana chips, and vanilla ice cream) and beautiful presentation is an equalizer.

We ordered the pork belly sliders, Vietnamese iced coffee donut, brown butter donut, coffee, chocolate milk, and an espresso shot. The caffeine was nothing to write home about but the chocolate milk was very good - just sweet enough.

The pork belly slider in my opinion wasn't very good. It needed more daikon radish and the cut of pork belly wasn't fatty enough.

Once we got everything squared away, we went to our room. It was very nice, with all kinds of amenities a hotel could offer you. Has a nice flat screen TV with guide so you can see what's on and very fast high speed internet access. 

There is plenty to do here, and if you go out to eat, you can have your dinner charges for whatever you ordered added to your hotel checkout bill, perfect for those who don't want to shell out the money right away. Be very respectful of your budget and keep track so you don't end up with a surprise at the end (we did not but sometimes it's easy to lose track of what you spend!)

The Casino... It's nice and has some fun slot machine games to play. The penny machines are very popular. Oh, and guess what, free drinks too while you are gambling.

We parked it at the bar and got the show from Sasha, the bartender, who kept up friendly banter with us even as she concocted a variety of beverages throughout the course of our stay. 

The cocktail menu was fairly extensive, broken down into Prohibition- and Repeal-era drinks, not to mention long lists of bourbons, ryes, and scotches. I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself, with my own brandied cherries, but here they do it the right way, all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle, perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!) 
For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. 

We also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. 

We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.

Overall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city.",2009-10-17 17:28:16

The burger itself was cooked to med-rare perfection the whole patty through, which makes me wonder if they sous-vide it and then give it a quick sear.   The meat itself, while quality, lacked proper seasoning.

Its ALMOST as dumb as the concept of a kobe burger.  In any event, it's a gimmick thats worked well for this restaurant, to be sure.  I took mine off and ate it separately.

I had a cheeseburger, fries with their cheese sauce, and a peanut butter milkshake.  The burger was okay, and I probably would've liked it better had I not put their homemade ketchup on it before tasting it.  I'm not sure what is up with their ketchup, but I just didn't really care for it.  Too sweet, perhaps?  It just didn't taste quite right to me. The fries were good, as was their cheese sauce.  And the peanut butter shake was amazing.  I did try some of my husband's food and I guess that's partially why I only am giving Bailey's Range 3 stars. He ordered honey mustard sauce with his fries, and there was nothing ""honey"" flavored about it; it just tasted like spicy mustard to me, which neither of us particularly care for.  I won't even get started on the bacon milkshake he ordered and didn't care for, because that's his own fault for ordering something so strange.  In short, I wasn't all that impressed.  If I ever go again, maybe I'll stick with the dessert and skip the food -- either that, or bring my own condiments!",2013-10-04 13:36:05

Went to the Cake Bake Shop again today for a piece of coconut cream pie. Paid $9.80 for one piece of pie. I think the owner should reevaluate the amount of embellishments (gift bags, fancy napkins,pink forks) and the amount of staff members standing around to lower the costs. The pie was just ok.

Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. 
 We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. 
  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here.

The bartenders were pretty quick to provide drinks as we waited, and the craft brew and cocktail menu is good. There isn't a very expansive selection, but what's available is diverse. The food is pretty stellar as well. My mussels were delicious and our nacho appetizer was great without any meat. Fresh jalapeños, black beans, and the perfect amount of cheese made them a delight. Our server is what missed the mark. She was courteous for sure, but her timing was really off. It took a while for us to order once seated and she altered between smothering us or ignoring the table. I also wasn't impressed with my friends' lamb tacos. The tacos come in an order of two or three, and this place seems to be stingy with the meat filling.

It has a selection from various cuisines, Chinese, Mexican and Indian. They kept all the areas well stocked with food.

The meat was not bad and also liked the roasted vegetables. The rest of the food was at best okay, the salad bar's vegetables and fruit were pretty sad looking. The fruits were rather disappointing, with only pineapple and Cantaloupe.

The dessert selection had cakes, gelato, creme brûlée and pies. I liked the gelato a lot, while the cakes and brûlée a were extremely sweet. 

For the $30 (post tax) on a Saturday night, it's not a bad value, but nothing amazing.",2014-05-26 02:01:36

I have became a fan of Earl's Sandwiches through my many trips to Las Vegas every year.

Every trip I make to Las Vegas, NV, I make it a point to eat there multiple times. So yesterday when returning to Philadelphia from a quick weekend trip home, I thought I'd treat myself to a quick sandwich before I was picked up from the airport. 

I ordered my regular Veggie Sandwich and although it was still tasteful and delicious it was different from the version I typically get in the Las Vegas Planet Hollywood casino. This PHL airport version had lettuce and tomatoes which the LV version does not, it was super peppery and the veggies had some sort of Italian dressing on them. 

I would definitely still recommend this location of Earl's Sandwiches to anyone wanted a great sandwich, however prefer the LV version better.",2013-05-28 20:38:29

It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold, gelatinous, and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap, fast food-ish, ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef, Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said, once upon a time), but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.

With each bite, I kept hoping the next would be better. But, alas. It wasn't. 

Why, RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch, is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.

This place is a bar first and foremost: its selection of innovative cocktails spans pages upon pages whereas their food offerings span two. So, liquor bar it truly is, but amazing food it definitely has.

But: the bites are pretty killer, from what I experienced. For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.

I landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.

(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)

The space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The ""kitchen"" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.

Oh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? 

So: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.

So... to the eats.

1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?

2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.

The rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.

Anyways, moving on (and this is important). To the cocktail: our very attentive/sweet server and I talked through a myriad of offerings and possibilities, and after much ado about bourbon, we settled on a variation of Seelbach with a locally aged bourbon. It was absolutely perfect. Mmmm, Seelbach.",2012-11-07 18:42:03

I think the first time I tried this place, it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya! 

I will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice, but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life, but like I said, they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time). 

As an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness, as an FYI, they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you.

Also, no credit card machine here so bring CASH.

WHAT WE ATE
*Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had, but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier, she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa.  

*Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking, but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. 

*Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. 

*Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. 

*Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar.

This place is cheap and the portion sizes are what is expected! I ordered the bahn mi with everything on it as starter and I was very pleased at how good it tasted and pricing about 2.50 something per sandwich you can't beat that! In the sandwich was liver pate, butter mayo whatever that good yellow sauce is, pork meat, pickled carrots and daikon radishes, cilantro, and jalepenos! One thing I did not like was how salty the pork tasted but I still ate the sandwich anyways. The bread was perfectly toasted and crusty, just the way bahn mi should taste! Also, to go alongside with my sandwich I got me a honeydew bubble tea. Man was this bubble tea awesome and flavorful and just the right consistency and the tapioca balls even were cooked just the way it should! 

Next, I ordered the pho with beef and meatballs. OMG, I forgot how good this pho tasted like the last time I ate here years ago. The bowl was huge for just about $7. This price and portion beats Thai Papaya down in the Antioch area. And even my daughter enjoyed at how good the texture of the rice noodles were! I usually add in hoisin sauce, sriracha, and whatever condiments are on the table depending on what I crave. But the pho broth without all the other added extra stuff is good without it!

What can I say about service? Well, they are really busy tending to other customers as well as this place is really busy and popular! At one point my water needed a refill but they never came to check on me after bringing my food. That leaves me with knocking down 1 stars.

I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  

First off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  

The hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated ""Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings"".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told ""our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted"" I replied ""I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted"" I was then told ""well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available"" and I said ""no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed"" and was told ""OK, sorry you are disappointed"".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.

Once we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said ""oh, they aren't running tonight"" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  

I'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  

Don't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.",2012-03-01 21:23:50

-I pre-ordered breakfast everyday via room service. It was consistently late (everyday) and they overcharged me - twice. When it came to check out, I expected the front desk to at least offer some kind of compensation for their oversight but they didn't.

When my work declared happy hour at this location, how could I not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers?

Now, I'm a fan of porters and stouts, so ML Rose never disappoints. This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.

If you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.

Because we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long). 

I would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back. Eat, drink, be merry at M.L. Rose. It's diner paradise for sure.",2016-11-22 00:15:52

Had a wonderful first impression.  Clean and modern with a friendly, attentive hostess.  The saxophonist was a nice plus.  I prefer a little ""harder"" jazz, but he was very talented and this is perfect dining music for most people, and my friends and I enjoyed it very much.  They informed me there is a jazz jam upstairs on Sunday nights; I will be there.
I am glad I had experienced ""guides"" with me.  I probably would have chosen something else if both of my friends (who had not previously gone to Sylvia's together) had not gone on and on (and on) about the pork chops.  I thought it would blasphemy to try something else.  Boy, they were right.  I had two pork chops so I could try both the fried AND the smothered.  They were both delicious and both completely different.  The fried was perfectly battered, not greasy at all, nicely flavored, and very tender.  The smothered was a wonderful, slow-cooked fall apart piece of heaven.  As it was all way too much for me to finish at one sitting, I will be enjoying the smothered pork today.
I had the mashed potatoes and collard greens.  Both were excellent and hot.  I asked for vinegar with my collards before tasting them, but they were wonderfully flavored without it so I didn't use it.  Mashed potatoes (with gravy) were excellent.  I am not a big fan of some of the sides that my friends got, but everyone wanted to share so I tried the sweet potatoes (excellent) and the tomatoes and okra (surprising good).  
I am not a big fan of corn bread, either, but they came to the table warm, slightly sweet, and moist.  Excellent.  
None of us had room for dessert, but our friend said we had to have the sweet potato pie and ordered us all an order to go.  I have another friend who raves about their peach cobbler.  I can't personally report, yet.
Service was very friendly and attentive, yet did not hover.

My date and I tried 5 items so I'll rate them all--salad was great, with a tart/sweet dressing in just the right amount.  The shrimp remoulade was good with plentiful fresh shrimp, but alas, was too salty.  The vegetarian entree was a bit odd and the items didn't have an apparent connection to one another.  I only enjoyed a couple of them.  The star of the night was the duck entree enjoyed by my date--wonderful sauce, crispy skin and perfectly prepared.  The bread pudding was saved from average by a wonderful praline topping that we both enjoyed immensely.

Prepurchased tickets online, ate dinner else where (since other reviewers had suggested the food isn't good there), got there 30 minutes early. Purchased my 10oz glass of wine & bottled water ($18.50 total. Ouch!) at the bar, and walked in with them in hand as one reviewer suggested. Got seated in freshly wiped seats (saw the guy cleaning & it smelled like bleach), and 3-4 servers began to take orders from the room. They were really hustling! All of the food looked like generous portions and looked yummy to Me. Seemed to all be out before the movie started. Unfortunately, I didn't order anything. 

I did notice that there aren't any call buttons like I have experienced at other similar luxury theaters. There didn't appear to be a mid-movie service either.

Pros:
1) lots of seating and spacious - you're never scrunched up against other people
2) outdoor seating
3) food is FABULOUS
4) TONS of variety of food and drinks (e.g., more than 15 varieties of hot tea, four varieties of iced tea)
5) discounts if you bring in your own cup as well as a punch card to earn free stuff
6) free wifi
7) seasonal foods as well - including a great blueberry season (O.M.G.!!)
8) clean and well stocked
9) lots of parking - always able to find a spot (and right next to a FedEx)
10) locally/family owned - gotta love and support that

Cons:
1) with so much seating they need to invest in some sound dampening materials.  It is SO LOUD when there are many people there.  And when there aren't - you feel like other people can hear you.  I never feel like that at Bread Co. - busy or not.
2) the prices are a little high.  Not a lot.  Just a little too high.

The enchiladas on the other hand were amazing as always.

Although I still think it's a little annoying that if you order them with a meat it comes on the plate almost like a side, the dish is still my favorite.

""Very hip vibe. You order either a salad or stir fry meal via a touch screen monitor (just like at wawa, for those familiar). I like to build my own, but they have several standard options to pick as well. 

My only gripe is it was a bit light on meat. You can add more meat when ordering, but I would have liked a bit more with the regular order. Speaking of which, be careful when adding veggies on the build your own, after 3 you incur a $0.35 charge. Not a huge cost, but it can add up if you don't pay attention.

The answer she got was no animal products.  After ordering the tofu vermicelli she found out it had fish sauce on it and told the waitress.  The waitress sort of stared at her blankly and didn't really know what to do.  Eventually we just asked to see the menu again and asked if the  sate veggies was vegan?  The waitress explained it was veggies with a lemongrass and spicy sauce.  The waitress said yes it was vegan.  She sked if they could make It less spicy, and was told yes. And so asked if she could have that instead.  When it came out it was steamed veggies with rice.  No sauce, nothing.  Some of the veggies had brown spots on them.  This was sent back and we went to lost love after for pho.

With vegan diets being so popular it would make sense if the staff knew their menu better and the chefs were able to actually cook something inspired for their guests with simple restrictions.  We went to bhava the night before with someone with a nut allergy and the chef made  an inspired dessert for them on the spot because there was no dessert they could eat on the actual menu.  With so many restaurants in New Orleans I wouldn't go back or recommend it.",2014-10-11 14:34:33

I was here for great Phillies playoffs wins this past season, including Halladay's historic no-hitter debut, and it was packed. That was mere weeks ago. What happened in the interim is a mystery, but while I will probably return, you can bet I won't be parking my ass here for future Iggles games.

I ended up sitting at the bar to see the awesome chef cooking for everyone in the restaurant. I ordered the Lamb Patty Melt, Drip Coffee and Donut Balls. 

Drip coffee was the best coffee I've had for months. Maybe I do need to find something else other than Starbucks. 

Lamb Patty Melt was a little hard to grab so I ate them as a toast + the rest of the sandwich. It has the right amount of lamb flavor and the bread was awesome. So was the fried egg.

This place needs to invest in some Bon Ami abrasive cleaner and get scrubbing. 

I don't think I've ever seen such a revolting restroom. It's as if they purposely decided NOT to clean the sink or toilet. Perhaps management is running a social experiment: to see how long it takes for someone to contract a communicable disease. 

I feel that my hands would have been cleaner had I NOT touched the handles on the sink. Just plain gross. I'm getting the dry heaves thinking about it. 

Maybe it's time for a bathroom remodel... 

Amazing selection of wines. But coming from california I found the markup borderline offensive on the Qupe. $27!?!?! It's a 16 dollar bottle back home. 

Service was good. Nothing to freak out about. The bartender was a touch surly upstairs, but he made me a mean drink. With tomato and tequila. Sounds weird but it was the highlight of the place. 

Next time I'm back in the area I'll definitely come back. But I'm just going to pee on the fence in the corner opposed to touching that filthy restroom. 

Oh yeah... The Christmas lights are cute and all strung up outside. But take them down inside. It's not a college dorm room people. Management: Keep this place as classy as you can by removing them. It's just tacky.

Anyway, the parking lot is a freaking death trap. People park in the fire lanes and clog up the aisles with their poor parking. A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that this place is the only grocery store for A LOT of people. The produce is unreliable, except they have a board by the front door that lists the local produce, which I LOVE, and use to buy as locally as possible. All other Rouse's don't have this, but they should. A few of the gentlemen that work in produce are helpful in answering questions about when items will return or where they are, etc. 

The bakery grinds out new fresh bread every day, and most of it is really tasty. Warning, though, they don't list the nutritional information on the packages, so you might get something you don't want in your tummy..

They've recently added a ""natural"" section, which has organic and all natural food/beauty products. This makes me very happy, but I usually buy the Rouse's brand organic canned goods because they are cheaper. 


As I mentioned earlier, this place serves as the sole provider of groceries to a lot of people. What that means to you is that on busy times (at like, 6 pm, or right before saints games..), it is so busy that you can't go in an aisle without smashing into someone, and it gets really frustrating.

The outside looks like a piece of crap but the inside was quaint and professional. Misha, the owner, shared a selfie with me and one of the patrons came over to our table, after he finished his meal, and jawboned with us about the local community lore.

However, they were also WAAAAY bigger.  I'm fairly certain that one person should never eat three beignet at a sitting anyway, but the idea of eating three of these gives me sugar shock.  We split an order, and I still couldn't finish.

That's not really a complaint, though.  Just be aware that, if you're going for beignet, you should bring an appetite - and two friends.  Anyway, we stumbled across this little gem while we were wandering around the French Quarter, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The atmosphere is wonderful - the Cafe sits at the back of an open courtyard, with tables (some under a patio), and on Friday night, there were musicians playing jazz.  The music carried well, without being so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I believe if you went up the stairs, there was a bar up there (although, probably another establishment).  I'm tempted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere alone, but a restaurant is more than atmosphere.  It was a wonderful way to spend a Friday evening.

Other than the beignet, the food was fine.  It was nothing spectacular, but I got a pretty good club, and my fiance got a pretty good roast beef po'boy.  My bread was a little stale - it happens.  It seemed like we had to wait an awfully long time for the beignet to come out.  I know they're fried fresh, but I've also made them before, and I know it doesn't take 15 minutes.

Michelle herself was great. She was friendly, fast and made getting a brazilian wax as pleasant as it could possibly be. She deserves 5 stars. 

Now the receptionists at this location are a whole other story. This was my first time at European Wax, so I was able to get my first wax for half off. I then bought a student package for $141 (buy 3 waxes, get 1 ""free""). With the package each wax comes out to about $35. I paid for my services and left. After walking down the block, I looked at my receipt and saw that it was under another woman's name (Jessica). Essentially, instead of adding the package under my name, the receptionist had added it under the name of the woman who had paid right before me. I quickly returned to get this sorted out because I obviously didn't want to pay for a package for someone else. 

When I returned to fix this, the woman who had rung me up (I believe her name was Jhana Wilson) was rude and unapologetic. Instead of trying to rectify her error, she said they were really busy (there were 2 girls behind me in line) and wouldn't be able to handle this and I should return later. I told her that this was her mistake, and I would like it sorted out regardless of how busy they were. There was also another woman sitting at the front desk to help with other guests. I said I wasn't comfortable leaving with a receipt that was issued under someone else's name and no proof of payment for packages under my name. Jhana was visibly frustrated by my persistence and didn't seem to care to resolve the issue at all  - even though it was the result of her carelessness. Jhana also said the manager was unavailable to speak with me to resolve the issue and I should return in a few hours, or wait 24-48 hours to get a call from someone. 

By chance, the manager (Alyssa) came out about 2 minutes later (so she wasn't unavailable after all?), and I was able to speak with her. Alyssa looked into the system and saw that Jessica's package (12 waxes) had been added to my account, and my package (4 waxes) had been added to Jessica's. She said she would need to file a form with corporate to swap our packages and it would take some time. I left the store with the issue unresolved. Thankfully within an hour I received a call from Alyssa saying she was able to resolve the issue and transfer my packages under my name. I appreciated that she had actually looked into the issue. That said, I was so turned off by the receptionist that I had to write this review. If I had not been persistent about getting this fixed, it would have gone unnoticed until either myself or Jessica came in for our next wax and realized our packages were all messed up. At that point, there would have been no way of knowing who our actual package had been issued to. 

I completely understand that mistakes happen, but giving customers attitude after a mistake should be unacceptable.",2014-11-13 17:10:32

I was extremely disappointed for several reasons this stay. 

First - the house keeping.  Words can't explain how lacking it was each day. They didn't replace soap or shampoo, they would leave the garbage, they wouldn't leave cream and sugar for the coffee even tho I left a note twice to please do so. I even asked for it when I saw one of the housekeepers and she said she would. 

But the icing on the cake is when the sheets were soiled and I pulled all of them off to note they needed to be replaced.  We didn't arrive back until very late that night so exhausted I pull the cover back and they put the same dirty sheets back on.  In what world is this normal??  I stripped them for a purpose and it was obviously they needed replacing. I had to sleep on towels,  I was so upset with this. 

Our friends travelling with us on the same floor down the hall also mentioned their housekeeping was below subpar unfortunately. 

The front desk was super unfriendly and the housekeeping just put the nail in the coffin for me. 

I will book elsewhere for Jazz Fest next time. 

Pros:  I did request a room off Bourbon because last time was very loud late at night.  We were on the top floor in room 60 and it was very quiet back there. No elevator and no steps and no drunk people.

Food was delicious. I had the caesar salad, short ribs & chocolate financier for dessert.  The short ribs literally melted in my mouth!
My husband & I split the shrimp cocktail which included only 3 but they were very large. These were good , wasn't crazy about the cocktail sauce.
He ordered the house salad with balsamic - equal to or even tastier than the tangy Caesar. For an entree he enjoyed the flounder paella style- which not only included rice but also clams, mussels & calamari. He devoured it in minutes :)
I forget the name is his dessert but there was mellon & a type of sherbet or pudding in the center. 
The meal is served with a seasoned bread & creamy butter. 
They also have a very nice lounge area surrounding the bar for an after or before dinner cocktail. There were people eating some apps there as well.

There was a group of 10-15 of us and the restaurant was spaced out well to where we did not feel crowded. We started off with the chicken 65, veg pakora, and shrimp Manchurian. All came out with good timing, hot, and fresh. The chicken was quite juicy and had the right amount of heat, the shrimp were plump and buttery, and the veg pakora were crispy and did not have that super oily taste that they sometimes can have. We ordered the lamb tikka masala and the tandoori chicken for our entree and I will have to say the lamb melted in our mouth. There was no gamey taste yet it definitely still had a nice lamb flavor to it which was accompanied well by the gravy. The tandoori chicken was good but I would not say anything special- it was lacking in the umami department although it was a nice pieces of meat. We ordered everything medium and it had the perfect amount of heat ( I would say we like heat but not anything that is going to make us sweat).

For those of you uneducated in this dish, it has nothing to do with BBQ. Weird, right? The large head-on shrimp are simmered in a rich sauce of butter, Worcestershire sauce and Creole seasoning and served with French bread. The flavor in this dish is beyond incredible, and after the shrimp are all eaten I'm sopping up every last bit of sauce with the bread.

I prefer to go there when I can get an outside table, or when I visit with a particular group of friends who also share in my sentiment of fondness. Now what the heck took me so long to experience Zorba's delivery?! Shame on me. It's the same delicious food, just in my pajamas in front of my TV. 

Having experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. 

I'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. 

We were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.

Speaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!  

Love that fresh bread they put on the table? Don't worry, you get that too.

I say this because I ate here last week, which was not to long ago, for a friend's birthday. There were about 7 of us, total. I called twice to change the reservation time, and they were very polite about it.

We were worried about not being able to eat here because we found out one of my friends has a peanut allergy. Knowing the way Asian restaurants work, a lot of them use peanut oil or peanut products in their food.

Three people that worked there came up to our table to listen to our orders to make sure that they got it right, and to omit any peanuts in the dishes. I believe one of them might have been the manager. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!

We ordered the roti canai (indian pancake), shrimp puff, young chow fried rice, hainanese chicken, sizzling beef, shrimp pad thai, deep fried shrimp with ginger soy sauce.

The roti is probably their most famous dish. Once you try it you'll know why. As soon as we sat down I asked if we could order an appetizer to start (since everyone was hungry and it was already 8pm). She asked if I wanted roti and how many, before I could even ask what I wanted. How'd she know? Two please!

The shrimp puff was so delicious! I'm warning you though to let it sit for a bit and give it 5 minutes. It is served HOT and WILL burn your tongue. The sauces tend to squirt out into your mouth as soon as you bite into it, which is no fun when it's extremely hot! Wait it out and you'll thank me later. The sauce was a nice touch to the shrimp puff. Very cohesive appetizer. You should definitely try this one.

Fried rice was average, as any Asian restaurant's fried rice is.

Hainanese chicken was very different ... never had anything like it. It's completely baked but served at room temperate so it gives off the feeling that it's being served ""cold"". It's actually pretty good with the soy sauce (which is served under the chicken) if you can get over the way it looks and the cold texture. We we're actually served a piece that was still blue and looked like a cyanotic chicken extremity which turned me off completely, even being in the medical field. Shivers. We decided just to set it aside and remove it so we wouldn't have to look at it anymore.

The sizzling beef was absolutely.. FORGETTABLE. Do not get this dish. It lacked flavor, and did not come out sizzling. Womp, womp.

The pad thai is also just an average dish. Nothing too special going on, probably would not get it again since I could get better pad thai elsewhere.

Now I saved the best part for last.. the deep fried fish! It normally comes with other sauces, but we requested to do a simple ginger and soy sauce. This is the best fried fish, ever! We all couldn't get our hands off it and fought for the last morsel! Main reason it was so good was because it was so crispy! Good to share due to it's size. Fairly big. I would totally go back for this.

wZrWIlELwUjhEOUZRA4JEQ,GdGGZo98_xRwbrZiYRP1ew,0wQCEcpZ57TmTm6EmEDsIw,4,1,1,2,"We made the journey through the cold and snow, all the way out to St Charles, with our friends the D's to try Hendricks BBQ.  We found a warm bustling place with a nice Saturday night feel and some decent barbecue.  Hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect; both St Louis style and back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and sausage (what no goat? Oh well.)  Hendricks has a seriously large menu, obviously centered around barbecue, but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat.

We had a great waiter, Aaron.  He was well informed ( I was impressed that he actually knew the definition of St Louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a Pick 2 platter, he informed us that each couple could split The Whole Shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price, so that is what we did.  Apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce, which ""meats"" with my approval.  There are four sauces on the table.  Each of these trays of meat comes with four sides; so Ms T and I had two slaws, greens and sweet potato fries.  The D's added cheddar grits, sweet potato casserole, green beans and baked beans.  So here we go from first to worst.

Hendricks makes good ribs.  Both the St Louis style and the back ribs were smoky, moist, tender and nicely seasoned with rub.  The rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness.  If it were over-applied, it would be too sweet, but it was in the proper proportion.  I would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other.

Next for me was the pulled pork.  I am not a fan of pulled pork in Missouri.  Often it is in large hunks and dry.  This was pulled to bite size and was moist, but not wet.  I would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs.

The brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods.  It had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor.  It was nice and tender, but was on the edge of dry.  This would also make a good sandwich, but might require some mayo to lube it up.  I know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket.  This is also worth ordering but at least this one night, was not quite as good as PM in Chesterfield  Valley.  Still pretty good for Missouri.

Turkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and I would not re-order them.  Turkey is always a real gamble.  If it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced, before any juices run out, it can be magnificent, as we experienced at Black's Barbecue in Texas.  This had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry.  It was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible.  I just would not order it again, though on another night it might be fine.  

The sausage was, hmmmm.  I almost liked it.  It was not like Hillshire Farms (a point in its favor).  It had some nice heat, Ms T and the D's found it too spicy but it is not really.  I like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in Texas.  They can be sensational.  My issue with this was that it tasted like Pine Sol.  This is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor.  Is it juniper berries?  A-1 Steak Sauce kind of has the Pine Sol thing going, maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix.  Whatever, all I can think of is ""the Power of Pine Sol, Baby"" when eating it.  I'll pass on that next time.

Sides - Ms D declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can.  (try some at Alcenia's in Memphis) They loved the sweet potato casserole, likening it to dessert.  They liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans.  I did not sample them.  Aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion.  

The only think Aaron was not accurate on was the slaw.  He thought it had no onion, but that was all I could taste.  This is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in Carolina.  It is unique, but inedible.  This was one of those rare times when we left the slaw.  It is unspeakably bad.  The sweet potato fries were fine.  The collard greens with bacon were good.  They were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat.  I enjoyed them.  There are even more sides to try.

Hendricks was worth the drive on a winter night.  I think we need to meet our St Charles friends, the L's there.  So go, have some ribs, maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  You will want to bring your own slaw.  I'm going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs.",2013-02-23 14:58:27

Salads , bagels with lox, omelet station and so much more. They feature a lot more local options for beers which is great for your wallet but some Belgian goodies make their list as well.  Chris had the hop wallop and i did as i always do a mimosa. As part of the buffet you get these amazing sticky buns. Though not a traditional bun it's just as gooey. It's a cross between baklava and a bun. It's made with puff pastry and is probably so bad  for you. They only bring out enough buns for the table so one person . They also feature a Benedict while were there it was spinach and crab along with a ham one. I wasn't really a fan the hollandaise sauce was bland and the English muffin was super soggy.  Chris ate the rest ( of course). I tried it and and won't make the mistake if ordering in when we come back. Another downside was the coffee tasted slightly old and bitter. For these two flops I deducted a star. The guy working the omelet station was super friendly. Our server was ok , very friendly though. Everyone who comes here on sundays does the buffet and at 17 pp it's a deal and then some .

We started with scallion pancakes, meh i've had better.  It was nothing special.  The guy had the spicy beef noodle soup, beef was braised as well.  The broth was delicious and spiciness level was a 5.  When he asked the waiter if the size was comparable to pho the waiter did not have a clue to what pho was.  You work in an asian resto my dude!  Granted this is not a viet joint, but you should be well rounded about asian cuisine overall.  Anyway, the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at Han's, the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it.  I also ordered the spicy cucumber, spiciness level was a 6.  After one helping i was over it.  The garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it.  My eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it.  I love this dish.  The minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp.  Shame that it was on the pricey side, $19.95.  I think there were only about 10 pieces of shrimps.  The guy had a chicken entree that he liked, nothing special.

Smiles were met with grumpy faces, waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way, questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely, the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail, she was pleasant).

Pros:

Service - wonderful
Bar options - excellent
No waiting!
Oysters on the 1/2 shell? Tasty, tasty, with no BP aftertaste.

Cons:

The shucker removed perhaps 4 out of 12 of the oysters from their shell. Not the seamless experience I wanted, and it stopped me from ordering an additional dozen. I was also surprised there wasn't a different type of dipping sauce, like a mignonette offered. I'm happy to make my own cocktail sauce, but I was surprised...
The gumbo? For me, it was odd - all roux, with not much seafood, chicken or sausage. And, rice seemed like a practice batch of risotto was used - it was gummy and crunchy.

I'm ready to go back and get more oysters, but maybe with a different shucker working....",2010-11-22 17:33:40

My husband and I went the Friday before V-Day (that's Valentine's Day, gutter-brains), and we really didn't know what to expect aside from guaranteed truffle oil (we know our Daniel Stern).

After a slightly awkward ascent via the elevator with a couple who looked like they might be going up to the 37th floor to push each other out the window, we arrived at a fairly fab, glam-but-not-overdone space that was obviously fancy but not so fancy that I wished I'd broken out the fur.

We waited at the bar and had a couple ""eh"" house speciality cocktails (something manhattan-ish... something else wtih gin...not memorable, obvi), followed by a couple glasses of wine.  I remember the eye candy who served my drinks more than what I had.  Gorgeous girls behind the bar and in the cocktail area.  When we were ushered to our table, we finally checked out the menu and saw at least 40 things we wanted to try, so we thought it over while snacking on olive loaf and sourdough bread - both amazing.

For starters, we ordered the warm spinach salad (I think it was served with pate?) with poached egg.  It was to die for -- perfect amount of egginess, great presentation all around.  I ordered the lobster roll (lobster roll with a hint of lavender!!) on house-made brioche, which came with chips and some other cute little lobster-tentacle-esque garnish.  I seriously housed this lobster roll, and hoarded it so that my husband couldn't have any.  Happy Valentine's day, baby.  F-ign unreal.

Main course... My husband ordered the salmon, which was poached in olive oil and probably the single best piece of salmon I've ever eaten.  I was SO JELLY over his order.  I had the flatbread with arugula and truffle oil (see earlier reference in part one of this food novella), and a side of broccoli, which somehow was the best broccoli I've ever eaten.  Someone obviously crushed pretty hard on the broc while they were making it, because it was unreal and just so delicate... Yes, I just reviewed a side of broccoli. For realsies.

Dessert (yeah, we went there) was beignets, and this crazed garbanzo bean cookie topped with poached pears and honey ice cream.  Our server brought out some delicious honey-related (I say related because I don't know if it was infused or how it got there) cognac to pair it with.  I had one of those ""food moments"" where I was like... You know what?  I'm okay with everything in life right now and I would like to have the Chef's love child in the very near future.

The place was completely crowded with people waiting outside for a table.  We are vegans and my wife is gluten intolerant.  There was only one item on the menu that we thought we could eat, a vegetarian ramen bowl.  We asked the waiter if we could get gluten free noodles and he said yes so we ordered two of the same for ourselves.  When the bowls arrived a different server said they were not gluten free as the broth was very cloudy.  The person who took our order neglected to tell us the broth was made with wheat and there was nothing else on the menu she could eat, everything had meat or wheat in it.  My wife rejected the order and I ate mine.  Wife had nothing to eat and had to sit there watching me eat mine. 
 
I find it amazing that in a restaurant that advertises itself as selling Japanese food doesn't have any Japanese dishes without meat or wheat.  Japan is or was a rice based food culture with many dishes without meat or fish.  All I can figure is Raijin thinks all Americans want meat and wheat so they design their menu accordingly.

Yoshimatsu restaurant on Campbell Ave. sells many meat and wheat free dishes.  

Raijin is also overpriced for what you get.  Yoshimatsu is cheaper with a lot more variety in the dishes especially ramen dishes.

We ate a a ramen restaurant in downtown San Diego recently that served vegan and gluten free ramen bowls.

I hope Raijin reads this and changes their menu because my ramen bowl was very good with the added garlic hot mixture I ordered as a side and put into my bowl. I would like to return there and give it another try with my wife.

I ordered the classic cheeseburger, and my husband ordered the tri-tip sandwich with gorgonzola at the recommendation of our server, Rhonda (she was awesome). My husband took one bite of his sandwich, which arrived very promptly, and said ""it has no flavor, and it's chewy."" I had the same thing to say about my burger. It was clearly hand formed, but it had absolutely no flavor. It seems the chef here has no concept of seasoning. Perhaps he wants his barbecue sauce to shine, and the sauce is very tasty, according to my husband, but in a barbecue place, the meat should shine too, and here, it certainly does not. 

All of the sandwiches come without sides, so my husband ordered a side of fries, ""extra crispy,"" as he always does. The side, which was pretty small for the price ($2), arrived, and they were chewy, not crispy at all. By the time he was done with his sandwich, he had to eat it with a knife and fork, because it became so soggy, it just fell apart, and it was impossible to eat as a hand-held sandwich. 

All in all, the service here is amazing. From the hostess greeting us warmly, to Rhonda helping us through the menu, and the manager stopping by, everyone was friendly, and extremely helpful. That doesn't make up for the lackluster food, however. Management has the service down, now they just need to work on the food, or I'm afraid this place won't last.",2014-05-25 20:36:35

They were good, but spicier than I would have thought.  What made them spectacular was the little bit of crispy duck skin on top.  It made the whole dish come together.

Everything was great, but I'm only giving it 4 stars primarily because of the price.  We'd love to go back, but the food is so pricey, we'll probably wait until a (very) special occasion.  

I had been to R2L for drinks during Center City Sips and wanted to try it for dinner as the menu looked very good and I couldn't get enough of the view.  The only reservation I could get was for 5:30pm on a Wednesday night of Restaurant Week (I really appreciate that they're on Open Table).  While we weren't there for sunset, the timing was fine as it turned out to be a cloudy day.  We had a table with a great view to the west.  

The server was so welcoming and accommodating.  Everything we ate was fantastic.  My risotto was awesome and a huuuuge portion, but my husband's entree wasn't as big.  Still hungry, he tried three times to get more of the bread (which was delicious, by the way), asking everyone that passed by our table from our server to beyond, but we never got a second helping which was a little annoying.

One item of note was the noise at the bar.  We were seated immediately adjacent to the bar area, and it was quite loud.  Both Wednesdays we were there, for Center City Sips a few weeks ago and for Restaurant Week recently, the bar was incredibly packed and loud.  R2L seems to be a swanky, popular place to get a drink after work, but maybe the crowd disperses a little bit later in the evening..

THE PROS: Very big menu with a lot of variety. I usually always order the Crunchy Mui Bueno, Tuna Tempura, and Sea Bass Yakitori. I love the sauce that comes w/ the tempura, and the Sea Bass Yakitori is sooooo delicious it melts in your mouth! I LOVE techno music so the music that is always blaring is super fine with me! The fried ice cream is also to die for! Whatever you do, DON""T forget to order the plum sake! It is served warm and it gives you the best warm, fuzzy feeling ever! (if you drink enough! lol) It's usually pretty lively in there which is also fine with me because I prefer to ALWAYS feel like I'm at a party. 

THE CONS: Although the food is USUALLY good, I have experienced times where the sea bass yakitori is TINY and the rolls are so huge you can't eat them in one bite. And for anyone who eats sushi rolls you know having to bite into one pretty much makes it fall apart. I've never had anything that actually TASTED bad, though. I have experienced waiters at times who take forever, forget you, and leave your food on the counter 10 min before they bring it to you. A few years back they always used to sing and make  a lot of noise (literrally) for your birthday. 5 years ago they even gave me a $25 giftcard for my birthday when I celebrated there. A couple years ago I made a reservation a few days in advance for my birthday because we were going to have about 10 people in our group. When we got there they had no recollection of the reservation and it still took 20 or so minutes to even get a table. :(  Last couple of years it doesn't seem like they do much for birthdays.  

Overall I think Ru San's is a fun place with good sushi and a cool atmosphere. Perfect start to a night of fun!!",2011-07-28 19:27:13

The service was very courteous and that is the only reason why I'd give it 2 stars instead of 1. They can prepare dish, according to their menu, at different spice levels. So, I selected one of the dishes that looked interesting (The King and I) and I ordered it to be prepared at medium spice without the pineapples that apparently came with it.

The dish came stocked with pineapples tasting like shrimps in sugar syrup ! I was in a hurry and didn't want to make a fuss of it, but regardless, when the host came by to ask how the dish was, I mentioned that it was too sugary. He explained that somehow his internet system had gone down when he was sending the instructions to the kitchen. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but with only 2 tables occupied in the entire restaurant at the time, perhaps a little more attention to what is happening in the kitchen and how the food is being served would do well.

I'd accept their apology, but to be a great restaurant, you need to look at various aspects of the experience and simply being courteous to guests is only but 2/5ths of task at hand.",2015-11-18 22:54:59

Trip One:
It was my first night in New Orleans and I was starving!  I went on Yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that Harrah's casino was right across the street.  Having been the Harrah's in Atlantic City several times (more times than I'd like to admit), I knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino.  I strolled into Grand Isle around 7pm on a Tuesday night, and thankfully it wasn't busy.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer - the Nola Blonde.  For an appetizer, I ordered the shrimp gumbo - how touristy of me!  It was really good!  Everything shrimp gumbo should taste like.  For dinner, I decided on the house made gator sausage po boy.  OH MY GOD amazing!  The flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious.  I knew instantly that I'd be getting this again before I headed back to PA.

I'm not sure if martinis were on special that night, but I saw a ton of them being ordered.  The ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on, so I'm assuming the martinis were pretty good haha.

Trip Two (two days after trip one):
My boyfriend arrived in New Orleans and I told him I had to take him to a few, great restaurants I had tried earlier in the week.  We headed over to Grand Isle!  For an appetizer, we got the Isle Sampler of oysters.  All of them were delicious, but the oysters fulton (with bacon, cheddar, and onions) was my favorite.  So good!  For entrees, I once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy (which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two).  You've already read my review about the gator po boy, so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada:  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful.  I can see why this won awards.

We spoke with the bartender a little bit, who was a super nice guy.  Turns out he's from NJ, so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland.

In short:  Go to Grand Isle.  Get some oysters, shrimp caminada po boy, the gator po boy, and a lot of beer (and maybe some martinis? haha).  You won't be disappointed!",2012-12-04 16:19:25

My food was bland, the spring rolls were fishy, the soda chanh was intensely sugared and I left feeling, ""eh."" We went last Friday and I ate pesce while there. I went with the tofu lemongrass and I seriously wish there was more sauce. It barely covered my tofu which left me eating unsauced noodles. I tried adding a ton of add-ons to try and get some flavor out of the sauce but no dice. The peanut sauce for the shrimp rolls was super watery and again the shrimp tasted old. The soda chanh was crazy sweet. I still enjoyed it but between that and the food I wavered between over-sugared and over-salted. My manpanion had the pho and he gave it an ""eh"" as well. I will say the prices were pretty awesome but I'm not sure we'll be back. There are other Vietnamese restaurants that I would rather frequent, e.g. Far East.

-Gz0Zc9UKGJcBDmLafK9Kw,duKhEm4zoR5G2nllvoxqgQ,5FuQbcHTF_I7PWJzhCMObw,4,1,1,1,"First - Dear YELP admins, how could the word ""hoagie"" fail your spell checker? C'Mon already!

Everyone has a favorite steak shop or two and they can be as different as night and day. White House, Tony Luke's, Geno's, Pudge's - like comparing apples and pigs, or Wilt to Magic, or Kung Fu to Karate, you just can't compare iconic examples different styles.

Larry's is like that. I've been coming for 30 years. Once or twice, I even stepped up to the Houseway Belly Filler. I think this was the first place I ever had a meat topping on a steak sandwich (pepperoni), but it wasn't the last. 

What makes Larry's Larry's? First, the guy is cooking in the window. Next, the steaks are chopped. Not shredded, fluffed, laid out or shingled. Even the toppings on our chicken cheese steak hoagie were chopped - a devout nod to every-bite-the-same sandwich science. A lot of work goes into every steak. Finally, the fresh Amoroso-style roll is just a little toasted, not enough to be a grinder, but certainly not steamed on the grill like an AC sub. 

When on Hawk Hill and hungry go to Larry's. Is it the best steak ever? Nah, but it is an institution and true to itself. As you take your first bite, envision yourself bustin curfew on the way home from seeing Neil Young at the Spectrum, or watching the Sixers take the NBA crown, or sweating whether Y2k will crash your Palm II. If you twist my arm, Larry's doesn't crack my top 5, but tradition is tradition, and Larry's has stood the test of time for good reason.",2011-04-23 18:46:55

The only thing I had to complain about here? The service was kind of weird. We had a reservation (although I really don't think it was necessary) and we waited for a long time before anyone came over to take a drink order. Plus, we had to ask to get water glasses and even then the water didn't come until AFTER they brought our regular drinks out.

VpgsJiM3zqrhrwJi8bkz2Q,FN7I6FXIzBvTRtl-TKrFtA,uVJkqQ1U9MH7hBorrwGhBg,1,2,0,1,"You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). 

The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.

The breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.

The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.

What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.

I would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.",2015-08-07 04:59:42

I called and made an appointment and was told my first visit would be 2 hours long. Upon arrival, I filled out various forms and answered lots of health questions before meeting my student acupuncturist. Soon Steve and Lori (Lori was very new and observing) took me to a separate room across the courtyard where the room was divided in two by Japanese type screens. I sat down with Steve as he went over my health profile and he asked very, very in-depth questions. After  spending considerable time doing this, I was asked to get up on the table. Steve felt pulses in various spots on my body and had Lori do the same. It's very interesting...they also look at your tongue several times! 

Finally, they decided on a treatment plan and left me to relax while they went to speak to the supervisor (I assume a licensed acupuncturist) to review the suggested treatment. Ten minutes later they came back and explained everything they'd do doing. Steve was very gentle and managed to hit all the right spots. Once all the needles were inserted, I was left to relax and listen to soothing sounds for about 15 minutes. They came back and took everything out and spent a few more minutes talking.

I've since gone back a few more times and on my last visit, Steve added acupressure seeds to my ear. He asked one of the students studying Oriental Medicine to do a consultation and a particular Chinese herb was suggested.

So going back to my opening, let me tell you this - it doesn't hurt! Acupuncture can be very beneficial for so many things - not just pain. Give it a try!",2014-06-11 23:07:57

The food itself was pretty mediocre. The boy and I did a weekend-long food tour of Philly and this was stop #65 or so, so we weren't extremely hungry coming in.

We came for the duckfat fries. But, well, they looked and tasted like normal fat fries except possibly on the drier side. The cheddar sauce helped a lot but I love french fries and believe good fries taste good without condiments of any kind, so the cheddar sauce wasn't too comforting to my fry-loving soul. We then split the chicken-fried steak. Holy oversalted batter, Batman! Waayyyy too much salty batter, about 0.23g of actual chicken. The gravy was okay but nothing remarkable and the biscuits were tender but too dense.

The Black and Blue burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned.  I like the buns, brioche style buttered and grilled so they are soft and crispy.

Although the view is just a parking lot, it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at. 

I ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides, I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it, which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too.

The bread basket was even good! I was full just from that alone and completely satisfied. But then for the main course I got the lobster paella. Not at all what I was expecting. I lived in spain and was thinking traditional paella. This was more of a seafood medley - no rice. It was delicious as well but just an fyi. Most people at my table got the steak and ribs which was also very good. Everyone enjoyed their meals. 

We had to go for dessert and ended up getting a vanilla cake with ice cream. So yummy. R2L also brough us 2 complimentary pallet cleansers which were interesting. Nice of them, but nothing to write about.

I don't live in Tucson but my girlfriend does and I only get to see her about 2 nights every couple months so its a special occasion when I do make it up to Tucson. Wanting to take her somewhere nice we booked Maynards. 

Arriving we had a hard time trying to find parking which wasn't the restaurants fault as downtown Tucson is undergoing some major improvements. Once we got inside the hostess was nice. We sat down and it took awhile for our waiter to make his way to us. 

We both were really excited and hungry for a good meal, the bread was extremely slow coming out and was rock hard, the service was not the best, our waiter was slow and didn't seem very busy even though it was Friday night. 

I ordered ""The Burger"" and my girlfriend had the Filet Mignon. The food made it out decently timed, but I was unhappy when I took a bite into my burger I ordered it Medium and it was burnt to the crisp, way past over done and had no color, just burnt black. For a 20 dollar burger it was not what I expected had no flavor what-so-ever. But the bacon I bought for an extra 2.00 on the burger was really good so that's a positive. 

Now for the positives, the Bacon was really good, the size of the burger was perfect. And the French fries on the side were amazing. 

My girlfriend loved her steak and I took a bite and it was really good so I was happy with her meal and she loved my fries as well.

Overall it wasn't that bad of an experience and I would dine there again, my rating is so low due to the burger not being cooked very good, might of been the waiters fault or the chief just wasn't feeling on his burger game that night. If we were to go again and I am sure we will I would definitely not be getting the burger and focus on there steak which was really good.",2013-01-29 00:05:49

I honestly don't understand how this restaurant got such high reviews. Either people had low expectations or they entered here drunk from an adventure at bourbon st or Frenchmen.

I ordered a river bend and it was made absolutely horrible. It tasted like medicine or as if the vodka was randomly thrown in grape juice and ass. 

I ordered a charcuterie board, little neck clams, oysters, Brussel sprouts, and the shrimp grits. The charcuterie board and Brussel sprouts were amAzing. The Brussel sprouts had a seared and sweet vinaigrette flavor. Even though I really prefer the charcuterie sampler at cochon butcher over the charcuterie here it was still good. It came with a rabbit pate which was wonderful.

As we waited for our clams to come out, the server came to notify us that they were out of clams (thirty minutes later btw). So we ordered a half dozen oysters instead. Those came out within five minutes. However instead of getting a half dozen oysters, we ended up receiving only five oysters on our plate. WTF?!?! We notified our server and he ended up bringing us two additional oysters which was nice, but seriously?! How does a restaurant like this hire people that don't know the basics of counting? That right there made me question the quality of the restaurant and how overhyped this was due to john besh. The oysters were shucked wonderfully but that's really all I can give them credit for.

Anyways, we finished all of our appetizers and waited an incredibly long time for the shrimp and grits. After waiting too long, we canceled our order with another waitress and our server finally came out to tell us that our order was ready but he wanted to wait for us to finish our appetizers to bring out the plate. I don't know of any restaurant that would make you wait an hour for your entree but sure... When the shrimp and grits came out I was honestly disappointed. 

I'm sorry to say but this restaurant may be nice but it absolutely does not deserve to be a four star restaurant. If you want good prices, good taste, and service I would go to royal house instead. Otherwise Ya no..... I would never go back here again nor recommend this place to someone else... I am so sad that this place was such a disappointment. Thanks John besh.

Ambiance = slightly gaudy (unattractive decor and faux flowers), a bit dark without feeling cozy.

Food = disappointingly lacking in flavor and quality.  We ate at the lunch buffet on a Saturday, if it were priced $4.99 instead of $8 I might be less inclined to complain, but it was entirely unexceptional.
I have eaten at many different Indian restaraunts in 5+ countries and multiple cities (most recently Monterey, California where Ambrosia is by far some of the best Indian food I've ever had) and Shere Punjab is one of the worst Indian food restaurants to which I have been.

The naan bread is thin and flavorless, vegetable dishes are significantly lacking in the expected robust flavors and spices, the texture of things (for instance the Saag (spinach dish) seemed as though it came from a can. Blended like baby food. Not a lot of selection.
There were no labels on the food at the buffet.

To say the least, this place did not satisfy my craving (nor my fiance's) for good Indian food and we will not be back.

I can only assume that the people who rave about this place have not had the fortune to eat TRULY mind-blowing, mouth-watering high quality Indian food.",2010-11-22 15:14:21

I made reservations for a Wed night for a group of 9 (this is their max). Good thing too, because every table was full. Since this is a BYOB, we had about 7 bottles of wine for the table. As I looked around, every other table had ice for their wine. I had to ask our waiter after about 15 minutes if he could bring us a couple ice buckets for the table. He took our wine and put it over on a window sill. This was a little strange, but it only got worse. We didn't know if it was appropriate to grab it ourselves or if he would pour it for us. We spent the entire evening walking through the restaurant to awkwardly pour wine. Not exactly how I wanted to spend my bday dinner. Its especially frustrating because this is a BYOB restaurant, you'd think this wouldnt have been an issue. Besides this, the service was fine. They also accommodate to the gluten free people out there.

Onto the food. We started with dips of the day, very authentic and tasty. I ordered the braised rabbit leg. I thought the meat itself was fine.

I stopped in on a few occasions during my week long visit to NOLA (only to their Mag St. location). Each time I visited the line was somewhat longer than what I had hoped. Although, the line went by very quickly. I waited 15 minutes or so tops on a super busy day. I can't really complain there. A few people in my party made a comment about how they should have a separate ""donut to-go"" window for people just wanting to get a quick donut or two to go. What a brilliant idea!

Per their name, they obviously serve items other than donuts. They have breakfast items (about 5 or 6 to choose from) till 11am. At 11am they begin serving lunch items - sliders and tacos. I am a huge fan of biscuits and saw that they make their own there. I had to try one of their breakfast biscuits. I opted to just try a scrambled egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. Holy cow it was delicious. Really hit the spot. 

I never got the opportunity to come back for their lunch items but I had heard from friends that their sliders are delicious! After seeing photos of them though, I had wished they were served on something other than little hamburger buns. Not too much excitement there if you ask me. I'd much rather have it on a biscuit.

Anyways, back to the donuts. They offer about 12 or so different donut flavors each day. They have their standard glazed, cinnamon sugar, iced donuts each day. Those are accompanied by different and interesting flavored (and sometimes filled) donuts. Check out their Instagram page to see what they are serving each day. It is a bit addicting logging onto instagram and checking their menus each day - I just wanted to go everyday and try all of them. My wallet would be so mad at me. Being the huge bacon lover that I am, I had been waiting to see their maple bacon donut show up on the menu.. my last day in NOLA, it finally did. I was pumped! It was delicious, fresh, flavorful, and savory. The bacon was honestly pretty good by itself.

I tried two of their drinks as well. The Sproca-Cola and their Arnold Palmer. Sproca-cola was interesting to say the least. I was glad I tried it - but don't think I will get it again. The Arnold Palmer was also pretty decent. My ratio of tea to lemonade was a bit off though - too much lemonade.

The establishment as a whole appeared clean and organized. My party and I were always able to find a seat no matter how busy it was. So with all of this said, I would definitely go back if in the area again.",2017-06-06 19:04:35

My cashier/food analyst, Crystal was flat out AMAZING. Crystal was enthusiastic, charming, and very knowledgeable about their menu. Every restaurant needs a Crystal. City Barbecue, if you read this, Crystal made my 1st experience at your restaurant a memorable one.

I ordered the More Cowbell per Crystal's recommendation, and I am so glad I did! this sandwich served on Texas toast was melt in your mouth good. Borderline sinful if you ask me. the brisket was spot on with flavor and tenderness. It was a little smaller than I expected for the price, but it was a lunch portion, so it makes sense. I am also glad it was not XL in size, it gave me an excuse to try their LoLo Pork. Served with vinegar slaw on the sandwich, it made me want to kiss the Pitmaster. Yes, that good. 

The vinegar slaw and baked beans sides complimented my sandwiches well, and they were a good portion too. 

The fresh brewed tea was so good too.

Because of that, you might suspect people are sniffing cocaine due to their boisterous attitudes, but after eating beignet's at Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street, I'm convinced that they are the reason for such things. Lol

Cafe Beignet offers better beignets than Cafe Du Monde and it's not even close.  They're far more fluffy, soft, well-sized, and deliciously powdered than any beignet I've had and it's only $3.99 for three!

Cafe Beignet has two locations--one being this one inside Musical Legends Park on Bourbon Street and the other on Royal.  I much rather prefer the one on Royal as it has a more clean and endearing environment.  This specific location on Bourbon is more fun and lively, but the distasteful smells of Bourbon Street creeps in from time to time.  I do love the live jazz music that is played though.  
----
Conclusion: Those who are looking for 5 star beignets and a lively, musical atmosphere, come to this outdoor location.  I, along with Mr. Alton Brown (famous food critic on the food channel) agree Cafe Beignet is much better than Cafe Du Monde.  Come here for food, alcohol, music, and the best beignets! can be found here too!

It's like a Vegas Style resort(One of the reasons why Nashville is refereed to as Nashvegas?). There are tons of restaurant options, fun little bars, and maps all over the place. I didn't get lost once. With that said..... 

My advice to someone coming to Nashville for the first time is... Don't stay here. Here are my reasons why: 

-It's far from town. About 10 miles. And let's be real...that's probably why you come to Nashville?

-Unless you have a rental car, you will be in Taxi or shuttle debt. One way to downtown in Taxi is $25 or the Gaylord shuttle is $30 something for Roundtrip...but the last pickup was a little too early for my liking. 

-The city bus doesn't come very often and doesn't run late. But a way cheaper way to get into town. ($1.60) 

-The restaurants are expensive and they don't have any local appeal. When I'm traveling, I want to eat local fare. Why isn't there southern food, bbq? 

-I feel like they basically want you to stay on their property the entire time! 

-Expensive! I didn't have to pay for my room (thank god) but if I had to I couldn't afford to.

Awful coffee. Just awful.

Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.

They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.

There was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience

And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.

Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked.

Milan was the student who did my nails, and even though she seemed a bit shy at first, she was very friendly, made conversation with me, and more importantly, she probably did a better job than many professional licensed manicurists have done on my nails.  Even though it is a cosmetology school, it has the vibe of a real salon with cool decor and friendly reception staff to boot, and since it is an Aveda school, it smells great too!  First time clients also get some free samples as well as a comment card which doubles as a 10% off coupon for your next visit!  I will definitely keep the Aveda Institute in mind for future services!",2010-08-21 00:51:27

I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save, what I would call, the worst dining experience of my life.

It's as if some lovely Greek-Cypriot family invited me to their home for a lovely Greek-Cypriot dinner, provided I bring my own wine and pay them about $40. I'd accept that invitation any day. 

Kanella simply offers classic, rustic dishes made with fresh, often organic ingredients by a chef who obviously cares a lot about his food. You'll see him buzzing around the dining room, advising diners on how best to enjoy the dishes before them. Might come off as heavy-handed, but this guy knows exactly what he's doing. 

Biggest hits for me include the whole fish (or any filet on the menu), duck breast and pork loin. For dessert, it's always the galaktobureko. Heaven.

There is even a nonsmoking slots area that actually smells clean. Too bad there aren't smoke free table games, that would have been awesome. I might even settle for vapping. 

I have been to a few casinos in reno and peppermill is now my new favorite. I booked early for Christmas and got a good rate on my rooms, though the resort fee did take me a bit by surprise, just because that was like half the cost of the room, and more than other hotels. I didn't take advantage of the amenities but I know there was a heated pool and fast internet. 

When you first enter the hotel, you can really see how nice it is.  The decor was gorgeous and inspired by Greek elements and I like the big screen tvs with scenery from around the world. 

I really like the restaurants in the casino. Went to the island buffet and had their seafood. At first I was hesitant just because most seafood buffets usually end in regret or are too expensive, but this one was reasonable for what you get. I ate 2 juicy tender prime ribs, 7 or so hot crab legs, 2-3 crab cakes, 6 giant scallops wrapped in bacon, and more goodies. I definitely overstuffed myself but still wanted more. 

Next was the happy hour at oceano. $1 oysters on the half shell, cheap appetizers, and $5 sake. Overstuffed myself again. 

Went to Biscotti for a scoop of gelato. It was huge, about the size of a fist. Would not recommend more than one scoop a person. Decent tasting gelato for the price. Uncomfortably full.

Next up was cafe Milano. Learned my lesson from the last two places and only ordered a waffle and a sandwich for me and girlfriend to share.  Food was huge but sooo good. The combo sandwich with corn beef and pastrami with a side of waffle fries was bomb. We were only able to finish half the sandwich because the meat was piled so high. Still I was stuffed.

I also appreciated how clean the restrooms were here, especially for when I had to unstuff. 

The tables I played at were good and the dealers were friendly. The only down part was I had to get up a few times when smoke from the person next to me started to bother me. I know pretty much every casino will have smokers at the tables, I may have been asking too much for a smoke free table.

First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot. 

Never the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had. 

Besides the horrible food, I've never been to a BBQ place that didn't serve Mac and cheese. One star and I will never give my business to this place again.",2015-03-05 17:49:44

Staff was really friendly and we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Felt like we were in a throwback New York joint. 

The only reason I'm not giving them 5-stars is because the crab cake, although mostly crab, was not very flavorful and overpriced for just being a single serving.

Very open with lots of windows. Magnificent views of the city and you don't hear traffic at all from the upper levels. I ordered room service and the food was great. Later, I accidentally locked myself out of my room and security helped me get back in. They checked my ID to make sure it was actually my room, which is good practice. I was apologetic but the security guy was so nice. Everyone I've interacted with today has been a joy. I wish I remembered the valet's name this morning. He was wonderful.

We walked in and were quickly asked ""Sushi or Hibachi?"".  The place is physically set up to serve Sushi on one side and the Hibachi tables are on the other side.  We said Hibachi which I thought meant individual tables and a back room kitchen made meal.  I was pleasantly surprised to be shown to one of those U shaped tables with the hot grill in the middle, a la Arigato's, Kobe's and a host of other Japanese Teppanyaki style cooking.  Ahhh, this is going to be good. We were a little earlier than the lunch crowd and it looked like the sushi side of the house was doing well.  Our side had 3 hibachi tables fully seated and the chef's doing their thing...ie egg into the hat, onion choo choo, etc.  
I chose Beef and Chicken and asked for only vegetables, no rice.  After all the fancy cooking, the metal spatulas and knives flying around, I got Beef and Chicken, vegetables and rice.  Later on, the manager and head Hibachi supervisor apologized time and time again.  No big deal.  I brought most of the rice home anyway for our granddaughter.  However, I noted one thing.  Don't be at the wrong end of the table.  It seemed the other folks to my right got decent portions of each item, I ended up with what was left, which appeared slightly less on the beef, chicken and vegetables.  Also, I asked for medium cooked on the beef, others asked for well done.  The beef went on and came off the grill at the same time, so how was mine any different from their's.

The menu is extremely creative and gargantuan! I love that they have some cheaper options, and plenty of variety.

Negatives:
Ru San's has the worst service I have ever had. On a typical dinner night out with my wife (even on odd weekdays), it has taken us over 2 hours to get out of there. The waiters seem to either disappear, or have so many tables that we tend to get neglected. On many occasions we have set at our table without drinks and with requests for more than 30 minutes before finally flagging down another server to find our server.

When I heard that a new Cuban place had opened in Indianapolis, I was so excited that I had my wife take me there straight from the airport. (Funny enough, she was picking me up after my trip to Miami, so Cuban food was already on my mind.)

The Fricase de Pollo (Chicken Fricassee) was just okay. It wasn't particularly flavorful, and the bed of rice it came on was soggy. 

We also ordered a beef pastelito, but got chicken. And while that's obviously not a terrible mistake, the pastelito itself was pretty bad. Much too sweet, and not in a good way. It was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago, and that have just been sitting around since then. 

The cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch, but ultimately, this also left us pining for Miami. The foamy top was exceptional, and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out. But it just didn't have the richness that we were expecting. 

It should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable. We particularly liked the crocodile-themed wall painting over the front door.

After we parked along the street nearby, I went in to ask if we could sit out on the patio and although the hostess was not spotted, I saw two staffers chatting at the bar area who immediately spotted me, so I asked them about sitting on the patio.  One of them said we could and apologized about not being up front at the restaurant when I walked in, which was totally fine with us.  He was very, very nice and allowed us to pick a table outside and got us menus before our server came out, which was shortly after.  And with the great service - our server was very nice and checked in with us about getting refills, getting more beers, bringing anything else, etc...  She also was well-informed about the menu when we would ask for specifics on items.

Unfortunately though, I didn't like my burger as much as I had hoped.  I ordered the Taco Truck Burger, which came with guac, sour cream and tortilla chips on a burger, so sounded amazing!  But it wasn't something I'd order again, as I thought it was very bland - even with all of the jazzed up toppings.  It didn't taste like the patty was seasoned at all nor the guac, which was odd.  The sweet potato tots though were yummy.  I do like that instead of fries you can get tots, especially sweet potato tots.  I recommend getting the sweet potato tots with the garlic aioli that the server recommended for me when I asked if she could bring me an aioli to go with.  I just wished the burger had been more to my liking.

I'm not sure if it was when I was a little kid, when my parents were progressive enough to give us a dab of hot sauce when we said a bad word when the craving for spicy dishes began. It could have been eating ridiculous amounts of wings weekly in high school, or dating someone whose father grows sick nasty chiles where this inner beast of spicy came from. Yats completes me. 

My all time favorite dishes at Yats are the Spinach-Mushroom Étouffée and the Chicken Creole. I try to try everything, because with a rotating menu, there are special dishes that are prepared only once in a blue moon, such as the Thai Curry Chicken Étouffée or Chili Cheese Étouffée with Chicken instead of the staple crawfish. 

Every meal at Yats comes complete with two slice of French bread with a super special butter. There are many choices in hot sauces, so pick your poison wisely. I like the Louisiana Lightning Strike and Cajun Power sauce (in the squirt bottle) to drench my Yats in the almighty power of spice.  I recommend using a heaping sprinkle on your French bread, and then putting a spoonful of your entree on top. HEAVEN!

A word to the wise, the College Ave location is cash only. The staff is very helpful to get around this problem. They'll give you an IOU, but they never forget. Make sure to remember this is cash only so you don't look dumb when you come back. 

Joe, the owner, is always at the College Ave location. Say hi to him, and thank him for bringing these flavors and such exciting food to a city that is known for being inside a circle and having cars drive 500 miles in a circle. (Indy loves Circles, I guess)

The interior looks more or less like an old library... takes us old folks back to our college days... nicely done... floating bookshelf over the bar... 

I wasn't overly impressed with the cocktail choices, I've been so spoiled lately from the vast collection of craft cocktails around town, so I just stuck to water. 

As I generally do drag my meet-up group with me, we had a table of 14 and this poor kid had to take care of all of us by himself. He got a little help when the main dishes came out, but other than that he was on his own. They even seated another table in his section. They knew we were coming, so I would say understaffed. Our waiter tried his hardest and he ran all night, but service could have been better had he gotten a bit more help or at least not be seated more tables. 

Anyway, let's get to the food. We often share dishes, so I had quite a few samples and here is my verdict:

Beer cheese tater tots: absolutely delicious, big portion, must have for any tater, cheese and/or bacon fan.. it hits all those areas.

Fried cauliflower: fantastic dish, also quite a portion, delicately breaded cauliflower fried to a crisp, tender but not mushy inside and served with an interesting ranch sauce.

Fried avocado: I was suspicious I must admit, but it turned out nice... not as big a portion as the other dishes, but nicely done. Coated avocados, deep fried, nice outer crunch, creamy middle, served with a grilled lime and a special ranch sauce... trickle some lime juice on the avocado and dip it in the ranch... omg good.

Shishito peppers: guess that's the new fad...basically roasted peppers... not as exciting as it may sound. The little sesame dip that came with it brought  most of the flavor for this dish. Lots of peppers though. 

Chilaquilles: seemed to be a nacho type creation with lots of chicken and cheese. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my for this dish, somewhat bland. big portion though.

French Fries: not worth it

Tater Tots: absolutely delicious

Onion rings: meh

Cucumber tomato salad: wonderful, large portion, nice vinaigrette, not overpowering, wonderfully light fresh salad. highly recommend giving it a try. 

Mac and cheese: good stuff

Doctorate burger: overrated and deemed not worthy of the price tag.

Double Major: good, but in my opinion was overdone and a bit dry.

French burger: a very drippy cheesy affair, nicely done though.

Overall I would say it's an ok burger spot. On the pricey side, but good for an occasional outing. I probably would just eat all the apps and sides because they were well worth it.",2017-10-25 18:14:29

We arrived @ about 10:00 AM, and the line was down 21st Avenue about 100 feet. We waited for about an hour to get inside. If you go to Pancake Pantry, expect it. When we got through and left about 12:30 PM, the line was still about 50 - 75 feet down 21st Avenue.

Quite frankly, I'm not sure why local people & others crave Pancake Pantry. The food is OK, it's a decent breakfast, but it's also over priced for the quality and quantity. I've had better & more pancakes, eggs, and meat, etc... at Cracker Barrel and other restaurants. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the breakfast. But, the quality and quantity is definitely not up to the hype. The sentiment for the other 3 people was about the same.

The service we received was exceptional. The waitress was on the ball, serving us coffee when we needed it, got our orders properly right, and kept making sure we were being treated properly.

What you are really paying for is the view here. While we didn't lay down a $200 deposit to guarantee a window seat, we did get one. I think this was because we ate so early on a Sat evening (5:30pm reservations). We were seated on the West side and the sun was setting. Fortunately I had my sunglasses with me although they did offer to pull down the shades for me as well. The views were definitely lovely but it likely would have been better had we gone later in the evening when the lights of the city were coming alive. 

Service was excellent throughout the entire meal. Our waitress took good care of my wife who is gluten free. We asked her what a few of the roads/bridges were that we were looking at, but she sort of guessed at it. You would thinking working there they would be required to know the more major landmarks out there. Oh well.

As for the food, that's what left me disappointed. I started with the Steakhouse Salad. I guess I just assumed there would be some meat in it, but sadly, there was none to be found. There were quite a few olives in there and unfortunately I'm not an olive fan, so ultimately I wasn't able to finish the salad. My wife's roasted shrimp though wasn't bad. For our entrees, she went with the Salmon while I had the Filet and Shortrib Duo. In the end, it was pretty good but it certainly didn't wow me or anything. I've had better meals and other restaurants in the city. At least the evening ended on a more positive note with dessert. My Lemon Tart was delicious and you can tell they have a pastry chef on site. Not many gluten free options for my wife, so she just had sorbet.",2016-06-24 10:35:47

And he was like you can come in the store and do two orders and I was wasn't going to do that so I told him I would drive around again even though it was completely unnecessary. So I got my food and went around again (still no cars had been through the drive thru) and ordered a single coke. Not even food which made it more annoying. But anyways. So we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we weren't gonna complain because we were already over this experience.

I don't want to call the space SMALL because it doesn't feel cramped. It's more like its interactive and fitting for a fast-moving burger joint. Think diner meets pizza place meets local bar type of feel. Low rise tables in front for relaxing, some hightops with a different perspective in the corner, and the bar-style counter make it so u can pick your style comfort.

They have a pickup route in NoLa so if one misses it, one can still get to a later stop and get on. Its a pretty comfortable ride to the swamp. You'll get to see (while in the shuttle bus) the abandoned Six Flags along the way.

Fair warning - BYOB. There is a little convenience shop where you pay fully for your ticket, but no booze. And the food gave some people stomach pains. But you can find various gator jerky. 

There are modular bathrooms that flush and have running water.

The swamp tour is pretty cool, you get to go under one of the lift bridges (?, they don't draw up in the middle, but lift straight up via four gears).

I like Schlafly Bottleworks as a bar/patio spot and I appreciate Schlafly's approach in general. They host some great events, have a really nice space, good beer, and have friendly service. But that said, the food has not been great for me here.

In my past two visits I've tried something pricey and then something cheap. Ho-hum on both. First - the pricey dish, which was the pretzel encrusted chicken. Schlafly is not the least bit shy charging $15-$19 for their entrees, and this one is $18. The chicken was a decent portion, I suppose. But it was a tad dry overall. Flavor just OK. The mashed potatoes which come with it were good. But for $18 I better be full and happy, plain and simple.

Then last night I was really hungry and went for the Bottleworks Burger. This was definitely a disappointment. I ordered it Medium, it came out pretty much well-done. That I could tolerate if it were either A.) Juicy or B.) flavorful. I got neither here. The potato wedges were awesome, however.

We ate some of the finest pastries I've ever had in my life at this bakery. Word.

We were fortunate enough to be with the other Gruntled Brunchers, who are friends of the proprietors of the bakery, so we were treated to a sampling of many of their pastries. 

Just some of what we tried: opera cake - a moist, multilayered cake which reminded me of tira misu; apple strudels; fruit tarts;  eclairs; chocolate covered strawberries. All were delicious, but, then, the cheese puff pastry came out. 

The cheese puff pastry is on a level all its own. Impossibly, insanely flaky, just sweet enough, almost salty. How can this be? I could have eaten five of these. Make certain you don't miss this.

We were fortunate to be there on Good Friday, so we could get a hot cross bun. I thought a hot cross bun was some hard crusted bread with a cross cut in the top for rising. I was so, so wrong. This traditional treat is a brioche-type bread with a tiny sprinkling of sweet fruit pieces throughout, and an icing ""X"" drawn on the top. Again, light, airy, with sweetness that is a hint, not a sledgehammer. There's a bunch of history behind the hot cross bun, and Patricia, the executive chef, took the time to tell us. Check it out on Wikipedia if you're curious.

And, I have to say something about the raspberry ""bear claw"". If you've ever had what others call a bear claw, forget those. Brent said it's an insult to this crazy-good, flaky, just-right pastry to name it the same thing you can get out of a vending machine. 

We took a field trip, as Harry said, through the kitchen, where Ziggy, the owner, pastry chef, and all-around nice guy, was making a Harry Potter wizard hat cake. He rolled out fondant icing and expertly threw the thick layer over the cake. He gave us a taste of the fondant. In my experience, fondant is pretty but not so tasty. Not so for this chocolate fondant. Mmmmmmm! I would happily have eaten a huge slab of this stuff. 

We left with a tea cake in tow. Ziggy told us it was something like a Kugelhof, and not as heavy as a pound cake. It was so beautiful, I simply had to try one, though at this point I really didn't need more pastries. I had a piece as soon as I could get a knife. Again, unbelievable...I can't say more. Somehow it was simultaneously buttery but light, and just moist enough without approaching stickiness. I had more of this than I care to admit right after I'd eaten my weight in sweets.

At this point, I'm glad I do not live down the street from Maple Street Patisserie. I could see myself having a problem if I lived too close to a bakery this tempting.

Just to sum it all up: the sweet pastries are delectable, but the breads, brioches, bear claws!, and tea cakes are in a class all their own.

And, I haven't even tried the savory croissants yet.",2011-04-23 00:00:54

The poboy list was astounding, and great contemporary takes on such things as 'Oysters Rockefeller'.

The chicken andouille sausage gumbo was fair. I've had better at various other establishments. A lack of rice, a lack of ""trinity"" (seasoning) and sparse nuggets of andouille and chicken were certainly a disappointment. The roux was the perfect darkness, but it lacked body and substance. I wouldn't have it again, and I don't recommend anyone try it, especially if you have had a good gumbo. It will fail to please.

The red beans and sausage were awesome. Creamy, with a great mouth-feel, superbly seasoned, the red beans may be the best I've had -- and I've been frequenting New Orleans restaurants for over three decades. The sausage was a great example of a good smoked sausage with a hint of piquant, crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. Now, the rice... why is it something so simple could ruin an otherwise perfect meal? First, red beans (unless you're serving soup) is traditionally served with rice. Rice should be fluffy, warm, and moist. This was obviously left in a steam pan with no lid. It was dry, hard, brittle, and inedible. Why even serve the stuff? Rice is cheap, make another batch, don't serve something you wouldn't stand behind!

The service was absolutely terrible. I had to wait to get a drink order (7 minutes, I timed it). I had to wait to get my drink (8 minutes, timed again). My food order was taken by another waiter who saw I had not been served, and by the look on his face, felt sorry for me. My waiter did not check on my food service until after I had finished my meal -- fortunately, the owner did check on me. I even had to wait to pay my bill -- which to me, if someone is looking to pay and leave, and you're in the business to generate revenue -- it's important to make sure they have the bill and make a timely payment.

After all the negative reviews, why would I give Katie's such a high rating? Well, I will tell you. A) The Food. B) the atmosphere C) I'm not going to let a worthless server ruin a good establishment D) the owner took an interest in my experience.

Try Katie's for yourself. If you have as bad of a serving experience as I had, inform the owner. I did not, and I regret it.",2015-04-01 21:20:04

The full-sized power salad was huge and tasty, kids' chicken strips were made from real white meat chicken (and were delicious), and the burgers were amazing. Fries and sides were creative. Service was prompt, friendly, and very welcome after a hot, exhausting day. Ice cream was home-made and creamy.

JU-7s2aFA5zJFib_tx4USQ,xqS2PjKu16g2cFDBNgJ8Ng,hS6KNGCQVTYUdLb2edt58g,3,1,0,0,I've been on the Natchez twice this year.  Once doing the dinner cruise (which is overpriced in my opnion but has very good bread pudding) and once without.  I feel like if you paid that much money to go on the paddlewheel that you probably should eat before and that way you can enjoy all of the sights of the ride so definitely eat before rather than do the dinner.  The food was good but it made no sense to pay for it with the cruise when you'd miss half of the cruise.  Nice people on the ship.  There's a mini steam room that's pretty cool for kids.,2014-10-27 22:01:21

Look, it's not a boat from the 1800's or anything like that. I believe it was built in the 70's or something. But you're in New Orleans, and these boats are a big part of the history and you should experience it to the fullest.

As a short 2-2.5 hour cruise, even as a local, it is worth the money. You can sit, stand, walk all over most parts of the boat, enjoy the sights and listen to the narrator. It's nice. They even serve drinks. VERY OVERPRICED drinks, but.... c'mon.

Don't bother with the food. For a seriously pricey premium you can take the cruise and get a lunch or dinner. I went on the Jazz lunch one time and it was just... meh. I was expecting a live jazz band playing some dixieland while I ate some etouffee or jambalaya or other staples like that. What I got was a piano player droning out modern day boring Kenny G jazz and a buffet of bland mediocre ""New Orleans syle"" food. SERIOUS waste of money. There are literally a dozen restaurants where you can eat in the immediate vicinity of the vessel, so WAIT and eat there. 

But like I said, the actual cruise is nice. I tell people to at least check it out all the time. Even if you LIVE here, you should check it out every now and then. 

I think they offer a cruise down to the Zoo. I'd like to try that.",2015-08-19 19:42:41

The noodles were tasty and the picked vegetables added a great contrast to the heartiness of the broth that kept the flavor balanced and not too savory. I also added on the black garlic wings because they were having a lunch special (add an app for $4). I was not a huge fan; even with lime juice sprinkled on the top, the fry on the wings was too heavy for me; I wonder if they were twice-fried? While I appreciated the crispiness, I would pass on these the next time around. I would add a caution that the restaurant is small and filled up for weekday lunch by about 12:15; they only have 4 2-person tables, 1 4-person table, and then the seats at the bar.

We are seated promptly and our waitress took our drink and appetizer order.  A short time later,  our drinks and appetizers arrived. The drinks were great and the guac with chips was fantastic.   

Our waitress took our dinner order and we patiently waited for our food.  The waitress checked on us frequently and kept us pretty hydrated.  As time passed,  we noticed that the restaurant was delivering food to tables that were seated after us and even sat new customers after those folks left and feed them too!

We asked our waitress, what's going on with our food? She replied,  ""hasn't the manager been out to talk to you?""  We said, ""no"" and our waitress said, ""I will ask her again to come out and talk to you.""  A short time later, a young lady came out and brought us complimentary guacamole and warm chips and said this is for waiting on the food.  

We waited a long time before we saw our waitress again.  When she came by she asked if we had talked to the manager. After we stated we hadn't, she proceeded to call the manager again and check on our food.

When the manager arrived at our table, it was the same lady who brought the chips and guac! She was very unpleasant and never provided any explanation other than it was busy and the steaks were frozen when we ordered them. Okay...let me apologize for my party ordering the t-bone steaks and for me ordering the cabreria. 

We explained that no one ever mentioned a delay or asked if we wanted to change our order which we could have done hours ago. She pretty much just walked away like no big deal if you are not happy. 

At least lie to me and say you ran out of some main ingredient and had to run to the store. Bring out the food that is ready and feed the antsy children on the table.  Very disappointed with how she handled the situation or I guess how she didn't handle it.

The food finally came out. I would like to give zero stars for the manager but food and micheladas were still great even though it took hours to arrive. 

BTW, the cabreria was fantastic.

They had really fun options for unique sodas (bottled) which is cool and next time I'll get one.  Same thing for chips too.

Since they don't take reservations for 2 people, and being the smart yelper that I am, I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in, there would be no wait, especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later, and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in, and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone, so he never got the message.   He walked in, took one look, and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name, and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time, until I left, which  is bad business, whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is), or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls, it's rude.

Don't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's, were promptly seated, experienced the best service there, as we always do, and left with full bellies, probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi.

After waiting almost an hour I'm called back and an older woman gets my weight and BP then starts asking questions (to fill in a computerized form) and giving me answers. Her name tag says ""Health Center Assistant II"". This means she is not a licensed provider and was out of her scope of practice to tell me what sorts of things were ""totally normal"" and ""nothing to worry about"". (I completed nursing school and one of the important parts of training is not to overstep and give patients advice you're not qualified to give. This woman was not a nurse nor a nurse practitioner.) She is also talking over me and cutting me off. At the conclusion of this little interview I'm told to go back to the waiting room and the NP will call me back shortly to see me. 

The nurse practitioner calls through the door, I walk into the hallway by the receptionist's desk, and she hands me 2 sheets of paper. ""Are these alright?"" I look. They're my prescriptions. I say, ""Yes."" She says, ""Then you're all set,"" and walks away. This was the extent of my ""appointment"" with the NP. She didn't even introduce herself, we never went into an exam room, there was no, ""Do you have any questions about all your lady parts that could get cancerous in your 30s?"" VERY unprofessional.

Uwhbs_vNGVG8badTsgVIAA,O4fJUCa4LAE2Dc2kwhdF6Q,jMZ56S8Y1t7cA1Ob-d-qeA,3,0,0,0,"I fell in love with Three Muses after looking at Yelp reviews and the restaurant's website. I feel that the website led me to believe it was a more formal tablecloth kind of place and I was a bit surprised when I arrived.  I could care less about tablecloths, just a minor observation as a direct result of the website.

When we arrived 20 minutes early for our 6pm Tuesday evening reservation we were greeted by the hostess and immediately informed that no matter what, there is a very strict policy that we would only have the table for 1.5 hours and that if we wanted to enjoy the music after that, we would have to go to the bar. I completely understand why this is their policy, but early on a weeknight when the restaurant is more than half empty it is a bit rude to start with the policy. Plus, what if our meal had taken longer than 1.5 hours? Are you booted to the bar for dessert?

Anyway, onto the food...below is a list of the items we ordered any any commentary:

-Italian baked Mac & Cheese-I LOVE every kind of cheese possibly imaginable and I was so excited for this dish. When it arrived the pasta was a little too firm and the flavor was extremely bland.  My friends and I barely ate a quarter of the dish. I would never order that again.

-Seared Scallops-I didn't eat them but my friends thought they were scrumptious.

-Bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates-these were incredible. For three of us we got the large order and though they were amazing, I kind of wish we got the small order only because they were so rich. A good kind of rich. I would order these again.

-Beer-Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly-I thought these were really bland, too. I wouldn't order them again.

-Steak & Cake-I only at the steak. I was told the crab cake was amazing and one of the best my friend ever had. The steak was awesome and so tender and flavorful.

-Ms. Moon's Bulgogi Rice Bowl-This item didn't seem to fit in as well with the other items on the menu but don't let it stop you. It was very very yummy and I would absolutely order it again if I went back. It was a hearty portion and the bowl was basically all but licked at the end to eat it all.

-Cardamon Panna Cotta (Ponchatoula Strawberry, Pistachio Biscotti)-I am not a huge panna cotta fan but my friend is and he loved it. I thought it was pretty good when I tried it but have no frame of reference with which to provide any more feedback. 

-Fluffernutter Pie (Bruleed Marshmallow, Salted Peanuts)-I was intrigued by this option and ordered it. I was underwhelmed and barely at any.

-Warm Chocolate Cream Cheese Brownie (Malted Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry)-per our waitress' recommendation we substituted the vanilla ice cream for brandied butter pecan ice cream and boy was she right. This was AMAZING. I loved the ice cream the most out of all elements of the three desserts. The brownie was tasty though I am not a huge chocolate fan.

The live music was nice and the atmosphere was okay. I have a feeling later on a weekend it would be a lot more lively and fun (and packed).",2015-08-06 23:13:13

During an early errand run with my daughter, I checked the area for a breakfast spot. I was reminded of this spot I've passed dozens of times, on the SE corner of Allisonville and 116th. We were seated quickly and greeted by a festive woman donned in sparkles and a Santa hat. 

As with other locations, they had specials, in addition to a full breakfast & lunch menu. I ordered a scramble and bacon that came with hash browns and an order of biscuits and gravy and toast. Z got an omelet with a side of fruit and a waffle. 

The portions were large and the hash browns were just the way I liked them. The gravy was a bit on the runny side, but not terrible.

We ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and ""microwaved to order"" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant. 

The tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was ""This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it, but this is how we make it"". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out. 

The gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another ""This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe"" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.

Finally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food.",2014-11-12 21:45:25

Keep in mind this isn't a typical piano bar. There is minimal seating intentionally as it has more of a bar/club feel than a lounge. The place is pretty relaxed until about 10-11pm. Then they clear out tables for a dance floor. It has a very energetic vibe.

If you want seating you need to get there early, 6 or 7, and camp out. Treat your server well if you are going to kerping seats all night. Choose a table on the side or back so it doesn't get taken away later in the evening. On a Saturday there was no cover when we arrived at 8pm, making it convenient for friends who weren't with the birthday group.

Now for the birthday group reservation. The package offered free entry plus a drink per person and a few other perks. It ended up being very convenient for our group as it carved out an area where we can all comfortably hang out with seats as well as mingle with friends who showed up spontaneously.

yENz1G4QE8g9uJAwJmBW3A,7LwLH1ppdxOcfYgHdSiDgQ,SwBhaxfQPbyhsi0QHUAN0A,2,7,0,1,"I've been going to this place since it was just the casino as I was not of age for the glory days of Seminole bingo. The HRC has had good moments and it's had bad moments. Yes, it is often very smoky; if this bothers you you may not enjoy the odor. The drinks are expensive but that's to be understood given that they aren't your local podunk dive. The casino has always been relatively clean when I've gone. For anyone complaining that the machines must be rigged because they aren't paying out, the reason that they are there is to take money from you and give it to themselves; payout is not guaranteed and you should never gamble more than you can afford to lose.

As to the service, my reactions have taken a steady downward turn since opening. My first time there my date and I enjoyed dinner at Floyd's and were served by a young man named Kurt (so good I remember his name all these years later) and were happy with the food and elated with his service. On other occasions I would go either alone or with coworkers. As my coworkers and I got out of work late the casino was a place we could go to eat, drink, and make merry. When we would arrive during late hours and eat at the open restaurants we were treated poorly by people that acted as though they did not want to be there and the food served was substandard. I am not a particularly picky eater but a slab of bend-your-fork frozen pie or green beans that hold a similar temperature to refrigerator from whence they probably came shouldn't be what I expect from a place that charges what the HRC does. If the restaurants don't want people to come in late they shouldn't be open, and if the employees don't want to work late hours they should find other employment. As for the casino employees on the floor I have a generally neutral impression as I don't bug them and they don't bug me but one particular instance stands out. On a brief jaunt through the slot machines on my way to dinner at the casino I won a hair over $10. I kept the slip and cashed out on my way out and the lady working the cashier's desk asked if I was serious about wanting this paltry sum. Surely if that is the attitude of the casino they wouldn't mind if I lost $10 and just took my money back because they have far more than I do and shouldn't mind me keeping that. I don't care if I won a nickel or thousand dollars; the only thing people working the cage should say about your winnings is, ""Congratulations.""

As to the new parking fee, I'm not looking to get the same canned response from their rep that everyone else has been getting. HRC can say anything they like about security or bringing themselves in line with other hotels; I've never had a security problem there and a business should be going out of the way to make themselves different from others. Anybody with a lick of sense can see that the reason for implementing the parking charge is as a way to keep the rabble out of the casino. As I've said I tend to go at night due to keeping late hours and brother, some of the folks that come late at night are skeevy as all get out. These folks come in already drunk, annoy other patrons, and spend nearly no money. The casino also makes no money off frugal folks that come in and take up seats while making the smallest bets possible and pinch pennies so hard that Abe Lincoln filed a restraining order. Implementing the parking fee is a way to keep the cheap or disruptive people out while not deterring the relatively small percentage of patrons that spend a lot and make up the majority of their profit. My main concern with using this tactic to keep out undesirables is that eventually the groups will realize that they can save the money by packing folks in to a minivan and splitting the cost between six or eight of them, only to have another pack of drunks or misers do the same and rather than ten individuals taking up ten parking spots and ten places at the casino you're have sixty or more individuals taking up ten parking spots and sixty or more places at the casino.

My rating on the facility is not incumbent upon the parking fee and reflects only the quality of goods and services provided. A place that prides itself on being different should be different in the right ways and as it is this facility is in dire need of a U-turn.",2016-08-26 17:46:51

The restaurants all around it were rowdy pickup joints with screaming twenty-somethings drinking margaritas and this was a welcome relief. The bar has a beautiful view and we took advantage of it. 

We sat at the bar and had the deep fried buttermilk quail app. It was so delicious I wanted another. We were not convinced we were going to stay for dinner until the last bite of the quail changed our minds.

We both had the prixe fixe menu with wine pairing and ordered one of each of the choices. The grits souffle was DECADENT!!!!! I cannot begun to describe the flavor! Our dinners were superior. The filet was cooked perfectly and the chicken was heavenly and moist. The gnocchi side dish was light, flavorful and amazing. Whoever cooked it should be teaching chefs across the country.

quickly:
Crab cakes - tender and crumbly. They don't taste like ""crab"" which is what I prefer. The crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings (i loved those).

clam chowder - pretty standard. it didn't blow your mind, but it also wasn't too ""fishy"" which can happen with clam chowder.

We saw everyone ordering crab and lobster, and we just salivated at the thought - we had dinner plans later that day so we couldn't try any of the big shellfish items. They definitely looked delicious!

some notes: 
-The indoor seating is limited. It's a small ""shack"" at the end of the pier. It was cold and windy the day we were there (yeah, can you believe it?) so there was more of a wait to sit inside.

After years I finally found it! Luxe Nails is amazing! They are friendly, fast and most of all, they're really good at nails. I've had almost every nail tech there at this point and I'm never disappointed. The designs are great, their acrylic skills are on point, the price is SO reasonable (acrylic fill, gel polish AND a design for $34?!) and if you have an appointment you can get in and out in 45 minutes at the most. I really enjoy going there and start thinking about what design or color I want next because they can do just about anything.",2013-12-09 00:37:12

The older gentleman given the task of making our salads was a complete jerk. After being rushed to give him my toppings order several times, he told me he had other things to do. I responded that we could always go eat elsewhere if that was the case. He shrugged to let us know he didn't care, so out the door we went.

The decor is pretty unusual and it's fun to sit on the balcony. The food is great and all locally sourced and homemade, even their ice cream. And really, if you go, you have to try the ice cream. My favorite thing to order is the Rumchata milkshake, which is made from Rumchata and their homemade cinnamon ice cream.",2015-05-26 14:27:57

The nutter butter and Tennesee fudge are both amazing!  The red velvet cake ice cream is good too.  I would love to go back sometime and try out some more of their flavors.

If you are in Nashville, I would highly recommend putting it on your list of places to visit... especially if you are a fan of ice cream.",2012-03-01 03:14:38

They tend to have quick turnovers so the wait isn't all that long. If you go definitely try their freshly made in house juices. That's their specialty but their food is also great; I never leave a morsel on my plate (yes the manager teased me about this and gave me free coffee lol). The owners are great and that's reflected in the staff they hire.,2018-03-15 22:00:07

The eggs and bacon were fine but nothing out of the ordinary. The home fries were extremely bland; no amount of salt, pepper or ketchup could make them any better. The pancakes were alright but again- nothing special or worth raving about. The prices were, however, good for the amount of food you get.

Service was slow initially. We were seated outside and then it seemed as if the host didn't tell the waitress she had new customers outside, because we waited about 15 minutes for our order to be taken, and it required us asking a waitress walking by if she could take our order. From that point on, the service was good, but it lacked initially. 

The back porch was nice and quiet and overlooks the water.",2014-11-12 17:51:40

The food was different - woodsy - gamey but good.  They served venison, duck, rabbit, sweetbreads, etc.

Brian and the other guys walked me through the work I needed on my car, and I never once felt taken advantage of or blindsided. I ended up needing four new tires and a new hub cap, talk about bad news! But they were extremely professional, personable, and treated me like a human being. I've experienced auto shops that treat me like an idiot, that do a poor job fixing my car, or that tell me I need extra work done (for a fee, of course). It turns out I did need ""extra"" work, but Brian showed me the damage, explained the process, and showed a lot of compassion. And now my car is remarkably better. I will definitely be back in the future, and I would recommend Tires Plus in Flourtown to anyone.",2015-04-01 21:50:28
